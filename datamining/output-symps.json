  "title": "Autoimmune pancreatitis",
  "symptoms": "Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is difficult to diagnose. Often, it doesn't cause any symptoms. Symptoms and signs of type 1 AIP are similar to those of pancreatic cancer.\n\n\nPancreatic cancer signs and symptoms can include:\n\n\n\nDark urine\nPale stools or stools that float in the toilet\nYellow skin and eyes (jaundice)\nPain in your upper abdomen or middle part of your back\nNausea and vomiting\nWeakness or extreme tiredness\nLoss of appetite or feelings of fullness\nWeight loss for no known reason\n\n\n\nThe most common sign of type 1 AIP, present in about 80% of people, is painless jaundice, caused by blocked bile ducts. Type 2 AIP can present with recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. Pain in the upper abdomen, a common symptom of pancreatic cancer, is frequently absent in autoimmune pancreatitis.\n\n\nDifferences between type 1 and type 2 AIP are:\n\n\n\nIn type 1 AIP, the disease may affect other organs in addition to the pancreas. Type 2 AIP affects only the pancreas, although the disease is associated with another autoimmune condition, inflammatory bowel disease.\nType 1 AIP predominantly affects men in the sixth to seventh decade of life.\nType 2 AIP affects both men and women equally and has a younger age of onset compared with type 1 AIP.\nType 1 AIP is more likely to relapse after treatment is discontinued."

They might include:\nDizziness and fainting when standing, caused by a sudden drop in blood pressure.\nUrinary problems, such as difficulty starting urination, loss of bladder control, difficulty sensing a full bladder and inability to completely empty the bladder. Not being able to completely empty the bladder can lead to urinary tract infections.\nSexual difficulties, including problems achieving or maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction) or ejaculation problems. In women, problems include vaginal dryness, low libido and difficulty reaching orgasm.\nDifficulty digesting food, such as feeling full after a few bites of food, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal bloating, nausea, vomiting, difficulty swallowing and heartburn. These problems are all due to changes in digestive function.\nInability to recognize low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), because the warning signals, such as getting shaky, aren't there.\nSweating problems, such as sweating too much or too little. These problems affect the ability to regulate body temperature.\nSluggish pupil reaction, making it difficult to adjust from light to dark and seeing well when driving at night.\nExercise intolerance, which can occur if your heart rate stays the same instead of adjusting to your activity level."

This measurement is called a waist circumference. Weight-related health problems are more common in men with a waist circumference over 40 inches (102 centimeters). They're more common in women with a waist measurement over 35 inches (89 centimeters). Body fat percentage is another measurement that may be used during a weight loss program to track progress."

You may or may not realize that your obsessions and compulsions are excessive or unreasonable, but they take up a great deal of time and interfere with your daily routine and social, school or work functioning.\n\n\nObsession symptoms\nOCD obsessions are repeated, persistent and unwanted thoughts, urges or images that are intrusive and cause distress or anxiety. You might try to ignore them or get rid of them by performing a compulsive behavior or ritual. These obsessions typically intrude when you're trying to think of or do other things.\n\n\nObsessions often have themes to them, such as:\n\n\n\nFear of contamination or dirt\nDoubting and having difficulty tolerating uncertainty\nNeeding things orderly and symmetrical\nAggressive or horrific thoughts about losing control and harming yourself or others\nUnwanted thoughts, including aggression, or sexual or religious subjects\n\n\n\nExamples of obsession signs and symptoms include:\n\n\n\nFear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched\nDoubts that you've locked the door or turned off the stove\nIntense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way\nImages of driving your car into a crowd of people\nThoughts about shouting obscenities or acting inappropriately in public\nUnpleasant sexual images\nAvoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions, such as shaking hands\n\n\n\nCompulsion symptoms\nOCD compulsions are repetitive behaviors that you feel driven to perform. These repetitive behaviors or mental acts are meant to reduce anxiety related to your obsessions or prevent something bad from happening. However, engaging in the compulsions brings no pleasure and may offer only a temporary relief from anxiety.\n\n\nYou may make up rules or rituals to follow that help control your anxiety when you're having obsessive thoughts. These compulsions are excessive and often are not realistically related to the problem they're intended to fix.\n\n\nAs with obsessions, compulsions typically have themes, such as:\n\n\n\nWashing and cleaning\nChecking\nCounting\nOrderliness\nFollowing a strict routine\nDemanding reassurance\n\n\n\nExamples of compulsion signs and symptoms include:\n\n\n\nHand-washing until your skin becomes raw\nChecking doors repeatedly to make sure they're locked\nChecking the stove repeatedly to make sure it's off\nCounting in certain patterns\nSilently repeating a prayer, word or phrase\nArranging your canned goods to face the same way\n\n\n\nSeverity varies\nOCD usually begins in the teen or young adult years, but it can start in childhood. Symptoms usually begin gradually and tend to vary in severity throughout life. The types of obsessions and compulsions you experience can also change over time. Symptoms generally worsen when you experience greater stress. OCD, usually considered a lifelong disorder, can have mild to moderate symptoms or be so severe and time-consuming that it becomes disabling."

This is known as projectile vomiting. Vomiting might be mild at first. But over time, it becomes more severe as the pylorus opening narrows. The vomit may sometimes contain blood.\nPersistent hunger. Babies who have pyloric stenosis often want to eat soon after vomiting.\nStomach contractions. You may notice wavelike contractions that ripple across your baby's upper stomach area soon after feeding but before vomiting. These contractions are part of the digestive process known as peristalsis. The contractions are caused by stomach muscles trying to force food through the narrowed pylorus.\nDehydration. Your baby might cry without tears or become lethargic. You might find yourself changing fewer wet diapers or diapers that aren't as wet as you expect.\nChanges in bowel movements. Since pyloric stenosis prevents food from reaching the intestines, babies with this condition might be constipated.\nWeight problems.

The affected skin might heal with temporary changes in color (post inflammatory hyperpigmentation), particularly on brown or Black skin.\nNail psoriasis. Psoriasis can affect fingernails and toenails, causing pitting, abnormal nail growth and discoloration. Psoriatic nails might loosen and separate from the nail bed (onycholysis). Severe disease may cause the nail to crumble.\nGuttate psoriasis. Guttate psoriasis primarily affects young adults and children. It's usually triggered by a bacterial infection such as strep throat. It's marked by small, drop-shaped, scaling spots on the trunk, arms or legs.\nInverse psoriasis. Inverse psoriasis mainly affects the skin folds of the groin, buttocks and breasts. It causes smooth patches of inflamed skin that worsen with friction and sweating. Fungal infections may trigger this type of psoriasis.\nPustular psoriasis. Pustular psoriasis, a rare type, causes clearly defined pus-filled blisters. It can occur in widespread patches or on small areas of the palms or soles.\nErythrodermic psoriasis. The least common type of psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis can cover the entire body with a peeling rash that can itch or burn intensely. It can be short-lived (acute) or long-term (chronic)."

  "title": "Prader-Willi syndrome",
  "symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome can vary among individuals. Symptoms may slowly change over time from childhood to adulthood.\n\n\nInfants\nSigns and symptoms that may be present from birth include:\n\n\n\nPoor muscle tone. A primary sign during infancy is poor muscle tone (hypotonia). Babies may rest with their elbows and knees loosely extended instead of fixed, and they may feel floppy or like rag dolls when they're held.\nDistinct facial features. Children may be born with almond-shaped eyes, a narrowing of the head at the temples, a turned-down mouth and a thin upper lip.\nPoor sucking reflex. Infants may have a poor sucking reflex due to decreased muscle tone. Poor sucking makes feeding difficult and can result in failure to thrive.\nGenerally poor responsiveness. A baby may seem unusually tired, respond poorly to stimulation, have a hard time waking up or have a weak cry.\nUnderdeveloped genitals. Males may have a small penis and scrotum. The testicles may be small or not descended from the abdomen into the scrotum (cryptorchidism). In females, the clitoris and labia may be small.\n\n\n\nEarly childhood to adulthood\nOther features of Prader-Willi syndrome appear during early childhood and remain throughout life, requiring careful management. These features may include:\n\n\n\nFood craving and weight gain. A classic sign of Prader-Willi syndrome is a constant craving for food, resulting in rapid weight gain, starting around age 2 years. Constant hunger leads to eating often and consuming large portions. Unusual food-seeking behaviors, such as hoarding food, or eating frozen food or even garbage, may develop.\nUnderdeveloped sex organs. A condition called hypogonadism occurs when sex organs (testes in men and ovaries in women) produce little or no sex hormones. This results in underdeveloped sex organs, incomplete or delayed puberty, and in nearly all cases, infertility. Without treatment, women may not start menstruating until their 30s or may never menstruate, and men may not have much facial hair and their voices may never fully deepen.\nPoor growth and physical development. Underproduction of growth hormone can result in short adult height, low muscle mass and high body fat. Other endocrine problems may include underproduction of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism) or central adrenal insufficiency, which prevents the body from responding appropriately during stress or infections.\nCognitive impairment. Mild to moderate intellectual disability, such as issues with thinking, reasoning and problem-solving, is a common feature of the disorder. Even those without significant intellectual disability have some learning disabilities.\nDelayed motor development. Toddlers with Prader-Willi syndrome often reach milestones in physical movement \u2014 for example, sitting up or walking \u2014 later than other children do.\nSpeech problems. Speech is often delayed. Poor articulation of words may be an ongoing problem into adulthood.\nBehavioral problems. Children and adults may at times be stubborn, angry, controlling or manipulative. They may throw temper tantrums, especially when denied food, and may not tolerate changes in routine. They may also develop obsessive-compulsive or repetitive behaviors, or both. Other mental health disorders, such as anxiety and skin picking, may develop.\nSleep disorders. Children and adults with Prader-Willi syndrome may have sleep disorders, including disruptions of the normal sleep cycle and a condition in which breathing pauses during sleep (sleep apnea). These disorders can result in excessive daytime sleepiness and worsen behavior problems.\nOther signs and symptoms. These may include small hands and feet, curvature of the spine (scoliosis), hip problems, reduced saliva flow, nearsightedness and other vision problems, problems regulating body temperature, a high pain tolerance, or a lack of pigment (hypopigmentation) causing hair, eyes and skin to be pale."

You may have more PTSD symptoms when you're stressed in general, or when you come across reminders of what you went through. For example, you may hear a car backfire and relive combat experiences. Or you may see a report on the news about a sexual assault and feel overcome by memories of your own assault."

  "symptoms": "Symptoms can vary widely by type of porphyria and in how severe the symptoms are. Symptoms also can vary among people with the condition. Some people with a gene change that causes porphyria never have any symptoms.\n\n\nAcute porphyrias\nAcute porphyrias include forms of the disease that usually cause nervous system symptoms. A few forms also can affect the skin. Symptoms appear quickly and can be severe. Symptoms may last hours, days or weeks.\n\n\nThe most common form of acute porphyria is called acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). AIP may last hours or days. Intermittent means that the symptoms may go away but return later. When the symptoms occur they are sometimes called attacks.\n\n\nSymptoms of acute porphyrias may include:\n\n\n\nSevere pain in the belly, chest, legs or back.\nDigestive problems, such as constipation, nausea and vomiting.\nMuscle pain, tingling, numbness, weakness or paralysis.\nRed or brown urine.\nMental changes, such as anxiety, hallucinations or mental confusion.\nRapid or irregular heartbeats you can feel, called palpitations.\nBreathing problems.\nHigh blood pressure.\nSeizures.\n\n\n\nCutaneous porphyrias\nCutaneous porphyrias include forms of the disease that cause skin symptoms as a result of sensitivity to sunlight. These forms usually don't affect the nervous system. Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is the most common type of all the porphyrias.\n\n\nSun exposure may cause:\n\n\n\nSensitivity to the sun and sometimes artificial light, causing burning pain in the skin.\nSudden painful skin redness and swelling.\nBlisters on exposed skin, usually the hands, arms and face.\nFragile thin skin with changes in skin color.\nItching.\nToo much hair growth in affected areas.\nRed or brown urine.\n\n\n\nErythropoietic protoporphyria (uh-rith-roe-poi-ET-ik pro-toe-por-FEAR-e-uh), also called EPP, is a rare type of cutaneous porphyria. It's the most common childhood porphyria. Sun or artificial light exposure quickly results in painful skin burning, irritation and swelling. Small bumps and blisters also appear. Repeated exposures can cause thick, leathery skin and scarring."

These are small, bean-shaped filters in the body's immune system. A swollen lymph node is called a bubo. The word \"bubonic\" is describing this feature of the disease.\n\n\nIf a person has bubonic plague, buboes appear in the armpits, groin or neck. Buboes are tender or painful. They vary in size from about less than half an inch (1 centimeter) to about 4 inches (10 centimeters).\n\n\nOther symptoms of bubonic plague may include:\n\n\n\nSudden high fever and chills.\nHeadache.\nTiredness.\nNot feeling well in general.\nWeakness.\nMuscle aches.\nRarely, skin sores.\n\n\n\nSepticemic plague\nSepticemic plague occurs when plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream. Buboes may not be present.\n\n\nEarly symptoms are very general and include:\n\n\n\nSudden high fever and chills.\nExtreme weakness.\nStomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting.\n\n\n\nMore-serious symptoms may develop with advanced disease and organ failure. These include:\n\n\n\nBleeding from the mouth, nose or rectum, or under the skin.\nSigns of shock, such as seizure, rash and low blood pressure.\nBlackening and death of tissue, called gangrene, most commonly on the fingers, toes, ears and nose.\n\n\n\nPneumonic plague\nPneumonic plague affects the lungs. The disease may begin in the lungs, or it may spread from infected lymph nodes to the lungs. Symptoms can begin within a few hours after exposure and worsen rapidly.\n\n\nSymptoms may include:\n\n\n\nSudden high fever and chills.\nCough, with bloody mucus.\nDifficulty or irregular breathing.\nChest pain.\nUpset stomach and vomiting.\nHeadache.\nWeakness.\n\n\n\nIf treatment is not begun the first day, the disease progresses rapidly to failure of the lungs, shock and death."

If they don't cause symptoms, pituitary tumors usually don't need treatment.\n\n\nPituitary tumor symptoms may be caused by a tumor putting pressure on the brain or on other parts of the body nearby. Symptoms also can be caused by a hormone imbalance. Hormone levels can rise when a pituitary tumor makes too much of one or more hormones. Or a large tumor that disrupts the way the pituitary gland works may cause hormone levels to fall.\n\n\nSymptoms from tumor pressure\nMacroadenomas can put pressure on the pituitary gland, on nerves, on the brain and on other parts of the body nearby. That can cause symptoms such as:\n\n\n\nHeadache.\nEye problems due to pressure on the optic nerve, especially loss of side vision, also called peripheral vision, and double vision.\nPain in the face, sometimes including sinus pain or ear pain.\nDrooping eyelid.\nSeizures.\nNausea and vomiting.\n\n\n\nSymptoms from hormone changes\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t    Cushing syndrome\r\n\t    Enlarge image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\nCushing syndrome\n\n\nCushing syndrome\nWithout treatment, Cushing syndrome can cause facial roundness, weight gain around the middle body and upper back, thinning of the arms and legs, easy bruising, and stretch marks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t    Illustration showing person with acromegaly\r\n\t    Enlarge image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\nIllustration showing person with acromegaly\n\n\nIllustration showing person with acromegaly\nSymptoms of acromegaly include an enlarged face and hands. Changes to the face may cause the brow bone and lower jawbone to protrude, and the nose and lips to get larger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLow amounts of hormones\n\n\nMacroadenomas can limit the pituitary gland's ability to make hormones. When that happens, symptoms may include:\n\n\n\nTiredness or weakness.\nLack of energy.\nSexual problems, such as problems with erections and less interest in sex.\nChanges in menstrual cycles.\nNausea.\nFeeling cold.\nLosing or gaining weight without trying.\n\n\n\nHigh amounts of hormones\n\n\nFunctioning pituitary adenomas typically make a large amount of one hormone. That exposes the body to high levels of that hormone. Rarely, a pituitary adenoma may make more than one hormone. The following types of functioning pituitary adenomas cause different symptoms depending on the hormones they make.\n\n\nPituitary tumors that make adrenocorticotropic hormone\n\n\nPituitary tumors that make adrenocorticotropic hormone are called corticotroph adenomas. Adrenocorticotropic hormone, also called ACTH, causes the adrenal glands to make the hormone cortisol. ACTH tumors trigger the adrenal glands to make too much cortisol. This causes a condition called Cushing disease. Cushing disease is one cause of Cushing syndrome.\n\n\nCushing disease symptoms include:\n\n\n\nWeight gain and fatty tissue deposits around the midsection and upper back.\nRounded face.\nStretch marks.\nThin skin that bruises easily.\nThinning of the arms and legs with muscle weakness.\nThicker or more visible body hair.\nSlow healing of cuts, insect bites and infections.\nAreas of darkened skin.\nAcne.\nChanges in menstrual cycles.\nSexual problems, including problems with erections and less interest in sex.\n\n\n\nPituitary tumors that make growth hormone\n\n\nPituitary tumors that make growth hormone also are called growth hormone-secreting tumors or somatotroph adenomas. Too much growth hormone leads to a condition known as acromegaly. Acromegaly can cause:\n\n\n\nChanges in facial features, including larger lips, nose and tongue; longer lower jaw; and wide spaces between teeth.\nGrowth of hands and feet.\nThicker skin.\nMore sweating and body odor.\nJoint pain.\nA deeper voice.\n\n\n\nChildren and teens who have too much growth hormone might also grow faster or taller than usual. This condition is called gigantism.\n\n\nPituitary tumors that make luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone\n\n\nLuteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are also known as gonadotropins. Pituitary tumors that make these hormones are called gonadotroph adenomas.\n\n\nIt's uncommon for these adenomas to make too many hormones that then trigger symptoms. Instead, symptoms from these adenomas usually are due to tumor pressure. If symptoms do happen because of too much LH and FSH, they affect women and men differently.\n\n\nSymptoms in women may include:\n\n\n\nChange in menstrual cycles.\nFertility problems.\nEnlargement of and pain in the ovaries caused by a condition called ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome.\n\n\n\nSymptoms in men may include:\n\n\n\nEnlarged testicles.\nHigher levels of testosterone.\n\n\n\nPituitary tumors that make prolactin\n\n\nThese adenomas are called prolactinomas. Too much of the hormone prolactin can lead to a decrease in the body's levels of sex hormones \u2014 estrogen and testosterone. Too much prolactin affects men and women differently.\n\n\nIn women, too much prolactin might cause:\n\n\n\nIrregular menstrual cycles.\nLack of menstrual cycles.\nMilky discharge from the breasts.\nBreast tenderness.\nProblems with fertility.\nLess interest in sex.\n\n\n\nIn men, too much prolactin can cause a condition called male hypogonadism. Symptoms might include:\n\n\n\nProblems with erections.\nLess interest in sex.\nBreast growth.\nProblems with fertility.\nLess body and facial hair.\n\n\n\nPituitary tumors that make thyroid-stimulating hormone\n\n\nPituitary tumors that make thyroid-stimulating hormone are called thyrotroph adenomas. They also may be referred to as thyroid-stimulating hormone-secreting tumors. They cause the thyroid gland to make too much of the hormone thyroxine, also called T-4. That leads to a condition called hyperthyroidism, also known as overactive thyroid disease. Hyperthyroidism can speed up the body's metabolism causing many symptoms. Some of the most common include:\n\n\n\nWeight loss.\nRapid or irregular heartbeat.\nNervousness, anxiety or irritability.\nFrequent bowel movements.\nSweating.\nTremor.\nSleep problems."

It's usually located just above the crease between the buttocks.\n\n\nCauses\nThere are no known causes for a sacral dimple. It is a congenital condition, meaning it's present at birth.\n\n\nComplications\nRarely, sacral dimples are associated with a serious underlying abnormality of the spine or spinal cord. Examples include:\n\n\n\nSpina bifida. A very mild form of this condition, called spina bifida occulta, occurs when the spine doesn't close properly around the spinal cord, but the cord remains within the spinal canal. In most cases, spina bifida occulta causes no symptoms and doesn't need treatment.\nTethered cord syndrome. The spinal cord normally hangs freely within the spinal canal. Tethered cord syndrome is a disorder that occurs when tissue attached to the spinal cord limits its movements. Signs and symptoms may include weakness or numbness in the legs and bladder or bowel incontinence.\n\n\n\nThe risks of these spinal problems increase if the sacral dimple is accompanied by a nearby tuft of hair, skin tag or lump, and certain types of skin discoloration\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff"

However, without treatment, babies usually develop signs of PKU within a few months.\n\n\nSigns and symptoms of untreated PKU can be mild or severe and may include:\n\n\n\nA musty odor in the breath, skin or urine, caused by too much phenylalanine in the body\nNervous system (neurological) problems that may include seizures\nSkin rashes, such as eczema\nLighter skin, hair and eye color than family members, because phenylalanine can't transform into melanin \u2014 the pigment responsible for hair and skin tone\nUnusually small head size (microcephaly)\nHyperactivity\nIntellectual disability\nDelayed development\nBehavioral, emotional and social problems\nMental health disorders\n\n\n\nSeverity varies\nThe severity of PKU depends on the type.\n\n\n\nClassic PKU. The most severe form of the disorder is called classic PKU. The enzyme needed to break down phenylalanine is missing or severely reduced. This results in high levels of phenylalanine that can cause severe brain damage.\nLess severe forms of PKU. In mild or moderate forms, the enzyme still has some function, so phenylalanine levels are not as high, resulting in a smaller risk of significant brain damage.\n\n\n\nRegardless of the form, most infants, children and adults with the disorder still require a special PKU diet to prevent intellectual disability and other complications.\n\n\nPregnancy and PKU\nWomen who have PKU and become pregnant are at risk of another form of the condition called maternal PKU. If women don't follow the special PKU diet before and during pregnancy, blood phenylalanine levels can become high and harm the developing baby.\n\n\nEven women with less severe forms of PKU may place their unborn children at risk by not following the PKU diet.\n\n\nBabies born to women with high phenylalanine levels don't often inherit PKU. But a child can have serious problems if the level of phenylalanine is high in the mother's blood during pregnancy. At birth, the baby may have: \n\n\n\nLow birth weight\nUnusually small head\nProblems with the heart\n\n\n\nIn addition, maternal PKU can cause the child to have delayed development, intellectual disability and problems with behavior."

While people with schizotypal personality disorder may experience brief psychotic episodes with delusions or hallucinations, the episodes are not as frequent, prolonged or intense as in schizophrenia.\n\n\nAnother key distinction is that people with schizotypal personality disorder usually can be made aware of the difference between their distorted ideas and reality. Those with schizophrenia generally can't be swayed away from their delusions.\n\n\nDespite the differences, people with schizotypal personality disorder can benefit from treatments similar to those used for schizophrenia. Schizotypal personality disorder is sometimes considered to be on a spectrum with schizophrenia, with schizotypal personality disorder viewed as less severe."

As ovulation becomes more unpredictable, the length of time between periods may be longer or shorter, your flow may be light to heavy, and you may skip some periods. If you have a persistent change of seven days or more in the length of your menstrual cycle, you may be in early perimenopause. If you have a space of 60 days or more between periods, you're likely in late perimenopause.\nHot flashes and sleep problems. Hot flashes are common during perimenopause. The intensity, length and frequency vary. Sleep problems are often due to hot flashes or night sweats, but sometimes sleep becomes unpredictable even without them.\nMood changes. Mood swings, irritability or increased risk of depression may happen during perimenopause. The cause of these symptoms may be sleep disruption associated with hot flashes. Mood changes may also be caused by factors not related to the hormonal changes of perimenopause.\nVaginal and bladder problems. When estrogen levels diminish, your vaginal tissues may lose lubrication and elasticity, making intercourse painful. Low estrogen may also leave you more vulnerable to urinary or vaginal infections. Loss of tissue tone may contribute to urinary incontinence.\nDecreasing fertility. As ovulation becomes irregular, your ability to conceive decreases. However, as long as you're having periods, pregnancy is still possible. If you wish to avoid pregnancy, use birth control until you've had no periods for 12 months.\nChanges in sexual function. During perimenopause, sexual arousal and desire may change. But if you had satisfactory sexual intimacy before menopause, this will likely continue through perimenopause and beyond.\nLoss of bone. With declining estrogen levels, you start to lose bone more quickly than you replace it, increasing your risk of osteoporosis \u2014 a disease that causes fragile bones.\nChanging cholesterol levels. Declining estrogen levels may lead to unfavorable changes in your blood cholesterol levels, including an increase in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol \u2014 the \"bad\" cholesterol \u2014 which contributes to an increased risk of heart disease. At the same time, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol \u2014 the \"good\" cholesterol \u2014 decreases in many women as they age, which also increases the risk of heart disease."

Laughter often turns to tears. Your mood will appear normal between episodes, which can occur at any time. Crying appears to be a more common sign of PBA than laughing.\n\n\nThe degree of the emotional response caused by PBA is often striking, with crying or laughing lasting up to several minutes. For example, you might laugh uncontrollably in response to a mildly amusing comment. Or you might laugh or cry in situations that others don't see as funny or sad. These emotional responses typically represent a change from how you would have previously responded.\n\n\nBecause pseudobulbar affect often involves crying, the condition is frequently mistaken for depression. However, PBA episodes tend to be short in duration, while depression causes a persistent feeling of sadness. Also, people with PBA often lack certain features of depression, such as sleep disturbances or a loss of appetite. But depression is common among those who have pseudobulbar affect."

Symptoms often begin on one side of the body and usually remain worse on that side, even after symptoms begin to affect the limbs on both sides.\n\n\nParkinson's symptoms may include:\n\n\n\nTremor. Rhythmic shaking, called tremor, usually begins in a limb, often your hand or fingers. You may rub your thumb and forefinger back and forth. This is known as a pill-rolling tremor. Your hand may tremble when it's at rest. The shaking may decrease when you are performing tasks.\nSlowed movement, known as bradykinesia. Over time, Parkinson's disease may slow your movement, making simple tasks difficult and time-consuming. Your steps may become shorter when you walk. It may be difficult to get out of a chair. You may drag or shuffle your feet as you try to walk.\nRigid muscles. Muscle stiffness may occur in any part of your body. The stiff muscles can be painful and limit your range of motion.\nImpaired posture and balance. Your posture may become stooped. Or you may fall or have balance problems as a result of Parkinson's disease.\nLoss of automatic movements. You may have a decreased ability to perform unconscious movements, including blinking, smiling or swinging your arms when you walk.\nSpeech changes. You may speak softly or quickly, slur, or hesitate before talking. Your speech may be more of a monotone rather than have the usual speech patterns.\nWriting changes.

When symptoms occur, the most common complaint is bone pain.Because this disease causes your body to generate new bone faster than normal, the rapid remodeling produces bone that's less organized and weaker than normal bone, which can lead to bone pain, deformities and fractures.The disease might affect only one or two areas of your body or might be widespread. Your signs and symptoms, if any, will depend on the affected part of your body.\nPelvis. Paget's disease of bone in the pelvis can cause hip pain.\nSkull. An overgrowth of bone in the skull can cause hearing loss or headaches.\nSpine. If your spine is affected, nerve roots can become compressed. This can cause pain, tingling and numbness in an arm or leg.\nLeg. As the bones weaken, they may bend \u2014 causing you to become bowlegged. Enlarged and misshapen bones in your legs can put extra stress on nearby joints, which may cause osteoarthritis in your knee or hip."

This test uses sound waves to create images of the beating heart. An echocardiogram shows the pulmonary veins and the size of the heart chambers. It also measures the speed of blood flow. An echocardiogram can help diagnose a hole in the heart.\n\n\nOther tests such as an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), a chest X-ray or a CT scan may be done if more information is needed.\n\n\nTreatment\nSurgery to repair the heart may be needed if:\n\n\n\nA lot of oxygen-rich and oxygen-poor blood mixes in the heart.\nThe condition causes many lung infections.\n\n\n\nIf you don't have symptoms, surgery may not be needed. If surgery for another heart condition is needed, surgeons may repair PAPVR at the same time.\n\n\nDuring PAPVR repair surgery, the heart surgeon:\n\n\n\nReconnects the pulmonary veins to the left upper heart chamber.\nCloses any holes in the heart.\n\n\n\nA person with partial anomalous pulmonary venous return needs regular health checkups for life to check for complications. It's best to see a health care provider who is trained in congenital heart diseases. This type of provider is called a congenital cardiologist.\n\n\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff"

  "symptoms": "SymptomsThe primary symptom of microcephaly is having a head size that is much smaller than that of other children of the same age and sex.Head size is a measure of the distance around the top of the child's head (circumference). Using standardized growth charts, health care providers compare the measurement with other children's measurements in percentiles.Some children just have small heads, with a measurement that falls below an established value for children of the same age and sex. In children with microcephaly, head size measures much smaller than average for the child's age and sex.A child with more-severe microcephaly may also have a sloping forehead."

Talk to your doctor about any change in the color or size of a mole or if itching, pain, bleeding or inflammation develops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t    Melanoma\r\n\t    Enlarge image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\nMelanoma\n\n\nMelanoma\nThe first sign of melanoma is often a mole that changes size, shape or color. This melanoma shows color variations and an irregular border, both of which are melanoma warning signs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMelanomas can develop anywhere on your body. They most often develop in areas that have had exposure to the sun, such as your back, legs, arms and face.\n\n\nMelanomas can also occur in areas that don't receive much sun exposure, such as the soles of your feet, palms of your hands and fingernail beds. These hidden melanomas are more common in people with darker skin.\n\n\nThe first melanoma signs and symptoms often are:\n\n\n\nA change in an existing mole\nThe development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on your skin\n\n\n\nMelanoma doesn't always begin as a mole. It can also occur on otherwise normal-appearing skin.\n\n\nNormal moles\nNormal moles are generally a uniform color \u2014 such as tan, brown or black \u2014 with a distinct border separating the mole from your surrounding skin. They're oval or round and usually smaller than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter \u2014 the size of a pencil eraser.\n\n\nMost moles begin appearing in childhood and new moles may form until about age 40. By the time they are adults, most people have between 10 and 40 moles. Moles may change in appearance over time and some may even disappear with age.\n\n\nUnusual moles that may indicate melanoma\nTo help you identify characteristics of unusual moles that may indicate melanomas or other skin cancers, think of the letters ABCDE:\n\n\n\nA is for asymmetrical shape. Look for moles with irregular shapes, such as two very different-looking halves.\nB is for irregular border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders \u2014 characteristics of melanomas.\nC is for changes in color. Look for growths that have many colors or an uneven distribution of color.\nD is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters).\nE is for evolving. Look for changes over time, such as a mole that grows in size or that changes color or shape. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as new itchiness or bleeding.\n\n\n\nCancerous (malignant) moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above, while others may have only one or two unusual characteristics.\n\n\nHidden melanomas\nMelanomas can also develop in areas of your body that have little or no exposure to the sun, such as the spaces between your toes and on your palms, soles, scalp or genitals. These are sometimes referred to as hidden melanomas because they occur in places most people wouldn't think to check. When melanoma occurs in people with darker skin, it's more likely to occur in a hidden area.\n\n\nHidden melanomas include:\n\n\n\nMelanoma under a nail. Acral-lentiginous melanoma is a rare form of melanoma that can occur under a fingernail or toenail. It can also be found on the palms of the hands or the soles of the feet. It's more common in people of Asian descent, black people and in others with dark skin pigment.\nMelanoma in the mouth, digestive tract, urinary tract or vagina. Mucosal melanoma develops in the mucous membrane that lines the nose, mouth, esophagus, anus, urinary tract and vagina. Mucosal melanomas are especially difficult to detect because they can easily be mistaken for other far more common conditions.\nMelanoma in the eye. Eye melanoma, also called ocular melanoma, most often occurs in the uvea \u2014 the layer beneath the white of the eye (sclera). An eye melanoma may cause vision changes and may be diagnosed during an eye exam."

Frostnip doesn't permanently damage the skin.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSigns and symptoms of frostbite include:\n\n\n\nAt first, cold skin and a prickling feeling\nNumbness\nSkin that looks red, white, bluish-white, grayish-yellow, purplish, brown or ashen, depending on the severity of the condition and usual skin color\nHard or waxy-looking skin\nClumsiness due to joint and muscle stiffness\nBlistering after rewarming, in severe cases\n\n\n\nFrostbite is most common on the fingers, toes, nose, ears, cheeks and chin. Because of skin numbness, you may not realize you have frostbite until someone points it out. Changes in the color of the affected area might be difficult to see on brown or Black skin.\n\n\nFrostbite occurs in several stages:\n\n\n\nFrostnip. Frostnip is a mild form of frostbite. Continued cold exposure leads to numbness in the affected area. As your skin warms, you may feel pain and tingling. Frostnip doesn't cause permanent skin damage.\nSuperficial frostbite. Superficial frostbite causes slight changes in skin color. The skin may begin to feel warm \u2014 a sign of serious skin involvement. If you treat frostbite with rewarming at this stage, the surface of the skin may appear mottled. And you may notice stinging, burning and swelling. A fluid-filled blister may appear 12 to 36 hours after rewarming the skin.\nDeep (severe) frostbite. As frostbite progresses, it affects all layers of the skin as well as the tissues that lie below. The skin turns white or blue-gray and you lose all sensation of cold, pain or discomfort in the area. Joints or muscles may stop working. Large blisters form 24 to 48 hours after rewarming. The tissue turns black and hard as it dies."

  "symptoms": "A tick bite may look like as a tiny, itchy bump on your skin, much like a mosquito bite. This doesn't mean you have a tick-borne disease. Many people will not notice they've had a tick bite.\n\n\nThe symptoms of Lyme disease vary. They usually show up in stages. But the stages can overlap. And some people don't have symptoms of the typical early stage.\n\n\nStage 1\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t    Lyme disease rash\r\n\t    Enlarge image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\nLyme disease rash\n\n\nLyme disease rash\nIllustration of Lyme disease rash on different skin colors. People with Lyme disease might get a bull's-eye rash. The rash gradually spreads over a period of days.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly symptoms of Lyme disease usually happen within 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. This stage of disease has a limited set of symptoms. This is called early localized disease.\n\n\nA rash is a common sign of Lyme disease. But it doesn't always happen. The rash is usually a single circle that slowly spreads from the site of the tick bite. It may become clear in the center and look like a target or bull's-eye. The rash often feels warm to the touch, But it's usually not painful or itchy.\n\n\nOther stage 1 symptoms include:\n\n\n\nFever.\nHeadache.\nExtreme tiredness.\nJoint stiffness.\nMuscle aches and pains.\nSwollen lymph nodes.\n\n\n\nStage 2\nWithout treatment, Lyme disease can get worse. \u00a0The symptoms often show up within 3 to 10 weeks after a tick bite. Stage 2 is often more serious and widespread. It is called early disseminated disease.\n\n\nStage 2 may include the stage 1 symptoms and the following:\n\n\n\nMany rashes on other parts of the body.\nNeck pain or stiffness.\nMuscle weakness on one or both sides of the face.\nImmune-system activity in heart tissue that causes irregular heartbeats.\nPain that starts from the back and hips and spreads to the legs.\nPain, numbness or weakness in the hands or feet.\nPainful swelling in tissues of the eye or eyelid.\nImmune-system activity in eye nerves that causes pain or vision loss.\n\n\n\nStage 3\nIn the third stage, you may have symptoms from the earlier stages and other symptoms. This stage is called late disseminated disease.\n\n\nIn the United States, the most common condition of this stage is arthritis in large joints, particularly the knees. Pain, swelling or stiffness may last for a long time. Or the symptoms may come and go. Stage 3 symptoms usually begin 2 to 12 months after a tick bite.\n\n\nThe type of Lyme disease common in Europe can cause a skin condition called acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans. The skin on the backs of the hands and tops of the feet get discolored and swell. It also may show up over the elbows and knees. More-serious cases may cause damage to tissues or joints.\n\n\nThis skin condition may show up many months to many years after a tick bite."

  "title": "Noonan syndrome",
  "symptoms": "Symptoms of Noonan syndrome vary greatly and range from mild to severe. These symptoms may be related to the specific gene containing the change.\n\n\nFacial features\nHow the face looks is one key feature that leads to a diagnosis of Noonan syndrome. Facial features may be easier to see in infants and young children but change with age. These distinct features become less clear in adults.\n\n\nNoonan syndrome may include these features:\n\n\n\nEyes are wide-set, slant down and have droopy lids. Eyes may be pale blue or green.\nEars are set low and look like they're tipped backward.\nNose is depressed at the top, with a wide base and round tip.\nMouth has a deep groove between the nose and the mouth and wide peaks in the upper lip. The crease that runs from the edge of the nose to the corner of the mouth becomes deeply grooved with age. Teeth may be crooked. The inside roof of the mouth may be highly arched. And the lower jaw may be small.\nFacial features may appear coarse but look sharper with age. The face may appear droopy and not show expression.\nHead may be large with a big forehead and a low hairline on the back of the head.\nSkin may appear thin and transparent with age.\n\n\n\nHeart disease\nMany people with Noonan syndrome are born with a heart problem that causes some of the key symptoms of the condition. This is called congenital heart disease. Also, some heart problems can occur later in life.\n\n\nSome forms of congenital heart disease related to Noonan syndrome include:\n\n\n\nValve conditions. Pulmonary valve stenosis is a narrowing of the pulmonary valve. This valve is the flap of tissue that separates the lower right chamber of the heart \u2014 called the right ventricle \u2014 from the artery that supplies blood to the lungs \u2014 called the pulmonary artery. Pulmonary valve stenosis is the most common heart problem seen with Noonan syndrome. It may occur with or without other heart problems.\nThickening of the heart muscle. Unusual growth or thickening of the heart muscle \u2014 also known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy \u2014 affects some people with Noonan syndrome.\nOther heart problems. Problems with heart structure can involve a hole in the wall that separates the two lower chambers of the heart, known as ventricles. This is called a ventricular septal defect. Another defect sometimes seen is narrowing of the artery that carries blood to the lungs for oxygen. This is called pulmonary artery stenosis. Or there can be narrowing of the major blood vessel known as the aorta, which carries blood from the heart to the body. This is called aortic coarctation.\nIrregular heart rhythm. This can occur with or without other problems in heart structure. Most people with Noonan syndrome have a heart rhythm that is not regular.\n\n\n\nGrowth issues\nNoonan syndrome can affect typical growth. Many children with Noonan syndrome do not grow at a typical rate.\n\n\nIssues may include:\n\n\n\nTypical birth weight but slower growth over time.\nEating difficulties that may lead to poor nutrition and weight gain.\nGrowth hormone levels that may be too low.\nDelay in the growth spurt that's typically seen during the teenage years because bones do not reach maximum strength or density until later.\nShort height as an adult, which is common, but some people with Noonan syndrome may not be short.\n\n\n\nIssues with muscles and bones\nSome common issues can include:\n\n\n\nA condition called pectus excavatum, where the breastbone and ribs sink too far into the chest. It also is possible to have pectus carinatum, where the breastbone and ribs grow outward, making the chest stick out more than usual.\nNipples that are wide apart.\nShort neck, often with extra folds of skin, called a webbed neck.\nA spine that has an unusual curve.\n\n\n\nLearning disabilities\nNoonan syndrome does not affect the intelligence of most people who have the condition. But they may have:\n\n\n\nA higher risk of learning disabilities and mild intellectual disability.\nA wide range of mental, emotional and behavioral issues that are usually mild.\nHearing and vision problems that may make it harder to learn.\n\n\n\nEye conditions\nCommon signs of Noonan syndrome are eyes and eyelids that are unusual, including:\n\n\n\nProblems with the eye muscles, such as cross-eye, also known as strabismus.\nRefractive problems, which means the cornea or the lens is egg-shaped with two curves that do not match. This can make vision blurry or distorted, or make it hard to see things close up or far away.\nRapid movement of the eyeballs, also known as nystagmus.\nCataracts, which make an eye cloudy.\n\n\n\nHearing problems\nNoonan syndrome can cause hearing problems due to nerve issues or an inner ear bone structure that is not typical.\n\n\nBleeding problems\nNoonan syndrome can cause bleeding problems and easy bruising. That's because the blood of some people with Noonan syndrome may not clot properly and may have low levels of proteins that are needed for clots to form. So they bleed longer than usual.\n\n\nLymphatic conditions\nNoonan syndrome can cause problems with the lymphatic system, which drains excess fluid from the body and helps fight infection. These problems:\n\n\n\nMay show up before or after birth or start in the teenage years or as an adult. Some children are born with swelling of the hands, feet and tissue of the neck.\nCan focus on a particular area of the body or be widespread.\nMost commonly cause too much fluid to build up in the back of the hands or top of the feet. This fluid buildup is called lymphedema.\n\n\n\nGenital and kidney conditions\nMany people with Noonan syndrome have problems with their genitals and kidneys:\n\n\n\nTesticles. It's common for males with Noonan syndrome to have undescended testicles. These are testicles that have not moved into proper position in the bag of skin hanging below the penis, called the scrotum.\nPuberty. Puberty may be delayed in males and females.\nFertility. For most females, Noonan syndrome does not affect their ability to get pregnant. But fertility in males may not develop as expected, often because of undescended testicles.\nKidneys. Kidney problems generally are mild and not common.\n\n\n\nSkin conditions\nPeople with Noonan syndrome may have skin conditions. They may have various problems that affect the color and texture of the skin. They also may have coarse or sparse hair."

Fluid from the seminal vesicles and prostate gland combine with sperm to make semen. The penis ejaculates semen during sexual intercourse.\n        Fetal developmentIf the body doesn't produce enough testosterone during fetal development, the result may be impaired growth of the external sex organs. Depending on when hypogonadism develops and how much testosterone is present, a child who is genetically male may be born with:\nFemale genitals\nGenitals that are neither clearly male nor clearly female (ambiguous genitals)\nUnderdeveloped male genitals\nPubertyMale hypogonadism can delay puberty or cause incomplete or lack of normal development. It can hamper:\nDevelopment of muscle mass\nVoice deepening\nGrowth of body and facial hair\nGrowth of the penis and testicles\nAnd it can cause:\nExcessive growth of the arms and legs in relation to the trunk of the body\nDevelopment of breast tissue (gynecomastia)\nAdulthoodIn adult males, hypogonadism can alter certain masculine physical characteristics and impair normal reproductive function. Early signs and symptoms might include:\nDecreased sex drive\nDecreased energy\nDepression\nOver time, men with hypogonadism can develop:\nErectile dysfunction\nInfertility\nDecrease in hair growth on the face and body\nDecrease in muscle mass\nDevelopment of breast tissue (gynecomastia)\nLoss of bone mass (osteoporosis)\nSevere hypogonadism can also cause mental and emotional changes. As testosterone decreases, some men have symptoms similar to those of menopause in women. These can include:\nDifficulty concentrating\nHot flashes\nWhen to seek helpSee your health care provider if you have symptoms of male hypogonadism.

They can be smooth, wrinkled, flat or raised. They may have hair growing from them.\nShape. Most moles are oval or round.\nSize. Moles are usually less than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters) in diameter \u2014 the size of a pencil eraser. Those present at birth (congenital nevi) can be bigger than usual, covering part of the face, torso or a limb.\n\n\n\nMoles can develop anywhere on your body, including your scalp, armpits, under your nails, and between your fingers and toes. Most people have 10 to 40 moles. Many of these develop by age 50. Moles may change or fade away over time. With hormonal changes in adolescence and pregnancy, they may become darker and larger.\n\n\nClusters of brown spots around the eyes, cheeks and nose are sometimes called flesh moles, but they are actually dermatoses papulosa nigra \u2014 a type of seborrheic keratosis, not clusters of pigment-forming cells (nevi). Dermatoses papulosa nigra are more common among Black women. Flesh moles don't carry a risk of melanoma, but they can be treated if you consider them a cosmetic concern.\n\n\nUnusual moles that may indicate melanoma\nA mole may be a sign of skin cancer if it has irregular borders or an asymmetrical shape or if it changes in color, shape, size or height. This ABCDE guide can help you remember what to watch for:\n\n\n\nA is for asymmetrical shape. One half is unlike the other half.\nB is for border. Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders.\nC is for color. Look for growths that have changed color, have many colors or have uneven color.\nD is for diameter. Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters).\nE is for evolving. Watch for moles that change in size, shape, color or height. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as itchiness or bleeding.\n\n\n\nCancerous (malignant) moles vary greatly in appearance. Some may show all of the changes listed above. Others may have only one or two unusual characteristics."

  "title": "Neurofibromatosis",
  "symptoms": "There are three types of neurofibromatosis, each with different signs and symptoms.\n\n\nNeurofibromatosis 1\nNeurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is usually diagnosed during childhood. Signs are often noticeable at birth or shortly afterward and almost always by age 10. Signs and symptoms are often mild to moderate, but can vary in severity.\n\n\nSigns and symptoms include:\n\n\n\nFlat, light brown spots on the skin (cafe au lait spots). These harmless spots are common in many people. Having more than six cafe au lait spots suggests NF1. They are usually present at birth or appear during the first years of life. After childhood, new spots stop appearing.\nFreckling in the armpits or groin area. Freckling usually appears by ages 3 to 5. Freckles are smaller than cafe au lait spots and tend to occur in clusters in skin folds.\nTiny bumps on the iris of the eye (Lisch nodules). These harmless nodules can't easily be seen and don't affect vision.\nSoft, pea-sized bumps on or under the skin (neurofibromas). These benign tumors usually develop in or under the skin, but can also grow inside the body. Sometimes, a growth will involve many nerves (plexiform neurofibroma). Plexiform neurofibromas, when located on the face, can cause disfigurement. Neurofibromas may increase in number with age.\nBone deformities. Abnormal bone development and a deficiency in bone mineral density can cause bone deformities such as a curved spine (scoliosis) or a bowed lower leg.\nTumor on the optic nerve (optic glioma). These tumors usually appear by age 3, rarely in late childhood and adolescence, and almost never in adults.\nLearning disabilities. Impaired thinking skills are common in children who have NF1 but are usually mild. Often there is a specific learning disability, such as a problem with reading or mathematics. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and speech delay also are common.\nLarger than average head size. Children with NF1 tend to have a larger than average head size due to increased brain volume.\nShort stature. Children who have NF1 often are below average in height.\n\n\n\nNeurofibromatosis 2\nNeurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is much less common than NF1. Signs and symptoms of NF2 usually result from the development of benign, slow-growing tumors in both ears (acoustic neuromas), which can cause hearing loss. Also known as vestibular schwannomas, these tumors grow on the nerve that carries sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain.\n\n\nSigns and symptoms generally appear during the late teen and early adult years, and can vary in severity. Signs and symptoms can include:\n\n\n\nGradual hearing loss\nRinging in the ears\nPoor balance\nHeadaches\n\n\n\nSometimes NF2 can lead to the growth of schwannomas in other nerves, including the cranial, spinal, visual (optic) and peripheral nerves. People who have NF2 may also develop other benign tumors.\n\n\nSigns and symptoms of these tumors can include:\n\n\n\nNumbness and weakness in the arms or legs\nPain\nBalance difficulties\nFacial drop\nVision problems or cataracts \nSeizures\nHeadache\n\n\n\nSchwannomatosis\nThis rare type of neurofibromatosis usually affects people after age 20. Symptoms usually appear between ages 25 and 30. Schwannomatosis causes tumors to develop on the cranial, spinal and peripheral nerves \u2014 but rarely on the nerve that carries sound and balance information from the inner ear to the brain. Tumors don't usually grow on both hearing nerves, so people who have schwannomatosis don't experience the same hearing loss as people who have NF2.\n\n\nSymptoms of schwannomatosis include:\n\n\n\nChronic pain, which can occur anywhere in the body and can be disabling\nNumbness or weakness in various parts of the body\nLoss of muscle"

The polyps are nearly 100 percent certain to develop into colon cancer or rectal cancer by the time you're in your 40s.\n\n\nCauses\nFamilial adenomatous polyposis is caused by a defect in a gene that's usually inherited from a parent. But some people develop the abnormal gene that causes the condition.\n\n\nRisk factors\nYour risk of familial adenomatous polyposis is higher if you have a parent, child, brother, or sister with the condition. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplications\nIn addition to colon cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis can cause other complications:\n\n\n\nDuodenal polyps. These polyps grow in the upper part of your small intestine and may become cancerous. But with careful monitoring, duodenal polyps can often be detected and removed before cancer develops.\nPeriampullary polyps. These polyps occur where the bile and pancreas ducts enter the duodenum (ampulla). Periampullary polyps might become cancerous but can often be detected and removed before cancer develops.\nGastric fundic polyps. These polyps grow in the lining of your stomach.\nDesmoids. These noncancerous masses can arise anywhere in the body but often develop in the stomach area (abdomen). Desmoids can cause serious problems if they grow into nerves or blood vessels or exert pressure on other organs in your body.\nOther cancers. Rarely, FAP can cause cancer to develop in your thyroid gland, central nervous system, adrenal glands, liver or other organs.\nNoncancerous (benign) skin tumors.\nBenign bone growths (osteomas).\nCongenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE). These are benign pigment changes in the retina of your eye.\nDental abnormalities. These include extra teeth or teeth that don't come in.\nLow numbers of red blood cells (anemia).\n\n\n\nPrevention\nPreventing FAP is not possible, since it is an inherited genetic condition. However, if you or your child is at risk of FAP because of a family member with the condition, you will need genetic testing and counseling.\n\n\nIf you have FAP, you will need regular screening, followed by surgery if needed. Surgery can help prevent the development of colorectal cancer or other complications.\n\n\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff"

  "symptoms": "Factitious disorder symptoms involve mimicking or producing illness or injury or exaggerating symptoms or impairment to deceive others. People with the disorder go to great lengths to hide their deception, so it may be difficult to realize that their symptoms are actually part of a serious mental health disorder. They continue with the deception, even without receiving any visible benefit or reward or when faced with objective evidence that doesn't support their claims.\n\n\nFactitious disorder signs and symptoms may include:\n\n\nClever and convincing medical or psychological problems\n\n\n\nExtensive knowledge of medical terms and diseases\nVague or inconsistent symptoms\nConditions that get worse for no apparent reason\nConditions that don't respond as expected to standard therapies\nSeeking treatment from many different doctors or hospitals, which may include using a fake name\nReluctance to allow doctors to talk to family or friends or to other health care professionals\nFrequent stays in the hospital\nEagerness to have frequent testing or risky operations\nMany surgical scars or evidence of numerous procedures\nHaving few visitors when hospitalized\nArguing with doctors and staff\n\n\n\nFactious disorder imposed on another\nFactitious disorder imposed on another (previously called Munchausen syndrome by proxy) is when someone falsely claims that another person has physical or psychological signs or symptoms of illness, or causes injury or disease in another person with the intention of deceiving others.\n\n\nPeople with this disorder present another person as sick, injured or having problems functioning, claiming that medical attention is needed. Usually this involves a parent harming a child. This form of abuse can put a child in serious danger of injury or unnecessary medical care.\n\n\nHow those with factitious disorder fake illness\nBecause people with factitious disorder become experts at faking symptoms and diseases or inflicting real injuries upon themselves, it may be hard for health care professionals and loved ones to know if illnesses are real or not.\n\n\nPeople with factitious disorder make up symptoms or cause illnesses in several ways, such as:\n\n\n\nExaggerating existing symptoms. Even when an actual medical or psychological condition exists, they may exaggerate symptoms to appear sicker or more impaired than is true.\nMaking up histories. They may give loved ones, health care professionals or support groups a false medical history, such as claiming to have had cancer or AIDS. Or they may falsify medical records to indicate an illness.\nFaking symptoms. They may fake symptoms, such as stomach pain, seizures or passing out.\nCausing self-harm. They may make themselves sick, for example, by injecting themselves with bacteria, milk, gasoline or feces. They may injure, cut or burn themselves. They may take medications, such as blood thinners or drugs for diabetes, to mimic diseases. They may also interfere with wound healing, such as reopening or infecting cuts.\nTampering. They may manipulate medical instruments to skew results, such as heating up thermometers. Or they may tamper with lab tests, such as contaminating their urine samples with blood or other substances."

A larger than expected fundal height could be a sign of fetal macrosomia.\n Excessive amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios). Having too much amniotic fluid \u2014 the fluid that surrounds and protects a baby during pregnancy \u2014 might be a sign that your baby is larger than average.  The amount of amniotic fluid reflects your baby's urine output, and a larger baby produces more urine. Some conditions that cause a baby to be larger might also increase his or her urine output. \nFundal height\n        Fundal height is the distance from the pubic bone to the top of the uterus measured in centimeters. After 24 weeks of pregnancy, fundal height often matches the number of weeks you've been pregnant.\n        Polyhydramnios\n        In polyhydramnios, excessive amniotic fluid accumulates in the uterus during pregnancy.

Things that startle you \u2014 for example, a telephone or an alarm clock \u2014 can cause you to lose consciousness.\n\n\nLong QT syndrome may also cause seizures in some people. Symptoms of long QT syndrome sometimes occur during sleep.\n\n\nMost people with symptoms of LQTS have their first episode by age 40. When the condition is present at birth (congenital long QT syndrome), symptoms may occur during the first weeks to months of life or later in childhood.\n\n\nGenerally, after a long QT episode, the heart returns to its typical rhythm.

  "title": "Epilepsy",
  "symptoms": "Seizure symptoms vary depending on the type of seizure. Because epilepsy is caused by certain activity in the brain, seizures can affect any brain process. Seizure symptoms may include:\n\n\n\nTemporary confusion.\nA staring spell.\nStiff muscles.\nUncontrollable jerking movements of the arms and legs.\nLoss of consciousness.\nPsychological symptoms such as fear, anxiety or deja vu.\n\n\n\nSometimes people with epilepsy may have changes in their behavior. They also may have symptoms of psychosis.\n\n\nMost people with epilepsy tend to have the same type of seizure each time. Symptoms are usually similar from episode to episode.\n\n\nWarning signs of seizures\nSome people with focal seizures have warning signs in the moments before a seizure begins. These warning signs are known as aura.\n\n\nWarning signs might include a feeling in the stomach. Or they might include emotions such as fear. Some people might feel deja vu. Auras also might be a taste or a smell. They might even be visual, such as a steady or flashing light, a color, or a shape. Some people may experience dizziness and loss of balance. And some people may see things that aren't there, known as hallucinations.\n\n\nSeizures are classified as either focal or generalized, based on how and where the brain activity causing the seizure begins.\n\n\nWhen seizures appear to result from activity in just one area of the brain, they're called focal seizures. These seizures fall into two categories:\n\n\n\nFocal seizures without loss of consciousness. Once called simple partial seizures, these seizures don't cause a loss of awareness, also known as consciousness. They may alter emotions or change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. Some people experience deja vu. This type of seizure also may result in involuntary jerking of a body part, such as an arm or a leg. And focal seizures may cause sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and flashing lights.\nFocal seizures with impaired awareness. Once called complex partial seizures, these seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness. This type of seizure may seem like being in a dream. During a focal seizure with impaired awareness, people may stare into space and not respond in typical ways to the environment. They also may perform repetitive movements, such as hand rubbing, chewing, swallowing or walking in circles.\n\n\n\nSymptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other neurological conditions, such as migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness. A thorough exam and testing are needed to tell if symptoms are the result of epilepsy or another condition.\n\n\nFocal seizures may come from any lobe of the brain. Some types of focal seizures include: \n\n\n\nTemporal lobe seizures. Temporal lobe seizures begin in the areas of the brain called the temporal lobes. The temporal lobes process emotions and play a role in short-term memory. People who have these seizures often experience an aura. The aura may include sudden emotion such as fear or joy. It also may be a sudden taste or smell. Or an aura may be a feeling of deja vu, or a rising sensation in the stomach. During the seizure, people may lose awareness of their surroundings. They also may stare into space, smack their lips, swallow or chew repeatedly, or have movements of their fingers.\nFrontal lobe seizures. Frontal lobe seizures begin in the front of the brain. This is the part of the brain that controls movement. Frontal lobe seizures cause people to move their heads and eyes to one side. They won't respond when spoken to and may scream or laugh. They might extend one arm and flex the other arm. They also might make repetitive movements such as rocking or bicycle pedaling.\nOccipital lobe seizures. These seizures begin in the area of the brain called the occipital lobe. This lobe affects vision and how people see. People who have this type of seizure may have hallucinations. Or they may lose some or all of their vision during the seizure. These seizures also might cause eye blinking or make the eyes move.\n\n\n\nGeneralized seizures\nSeizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain are called generalized seizures. Generalized seizures include:\n\n\n\nAbsence seizures. Absence seizures, previously known as petit mal seizures, typically occur in children. Symptoms include staring into space with or without subtle body movements. Movements may include eye blinking or lip smacking and only last 5 to 10 seconds. These seizures may occur in clusters, happening as often as 100 times a day, and cause a brief loss of awareness.\nTonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiff muscles and may affect consciousness. These seizures usually affect muscles in the back, arms and legs and may cause the person to fall to the ground.\nAtonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control. Since this most often affects the legs, it often causes sudden falls to the ground.\nClonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated or rhythmic jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms.\nMyoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches and usually affect the upper body, arms and legs.\nTonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure. They can cause a sudden loss of consciousness and body stiffening, twitching and shaking. They sometimes cause loss of bladder control or biting of the tongue."

For some people, endometriosis is first found during tests for infertility treatment.\nOther symptoms. You may have fatigue, diarrhea, constipation, bloating or nausea. These symptoms are more common before or during menstrual periods.\n\n\n\nThe seriousness of your pain may not be a sign of the number or extent of endometriosis growths in your body. You could have a small amount of tissue with bad pain. Or you could have lots of endometriosis tissue with little or no pain.\n\n\nStill, some people with endometriosis have no symptoms. Often, they find out they have the condition when they can't get pregnant or after they get surgery for another reason.\n\n\nFor those with symptoms, endometriosis sometimes may seem like other conditions that can cause pelvic pain. These include pelvic inflammatory disease or ovarian cysts. Or it may be confused with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which causes bouts of diarrhea, constipation and stomach cramps.

  "title": "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome",
  "symptoms": "There are many different types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but the most common signs and symptoms include:\n\n\n\nOverly flexible joints. Because the connective tissue that holds joints together is looser, your joints can move far past the normal range of motion. Joint pain and dislocations are common.\nStretchy skin. Weakened connective tissue allows your skin to stretch much more than usual. You may be able to pull a pinch of skin up away from your flesh, but it will snap right back into place when you let go. Your skin might also feel exceptionally soft and velvety.\nFragile skin. Damaged skin often doesn't heal well. For example, the stitches used to close a wound often will tear out and leave a gaping scar. These scars may look thin and crinkly.\n\n\n\nSymptom severity can vary from person to person and depends on the specific type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that you have. The most common type is called hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.\n\n\nVascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\nPeople who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome often share distinctive facial features of a thin nose, thin upper lip, small earlobes and prominent eyes. They also have thin, translucent skin that bruises very easily. In fair-skinned people, the underlying blood vessels are very visible through the skin.\n\n\nVascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome can weaken your heart's largest artery (aorta), as well as the arteries to other regions of your body. A rupture of any of these larger blood vessels can be fatal. The vascular type can also weaken the walls of the uterus or large intestines \u2014 which also may rupture.\n\n\nCauses\nDifferent types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are associated with a variety of genetic causes, some of which are inherited and passed on from parent to child. If you have the most common form, hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, there's a 50% chance that you'll pass on the gene to each of your children.\n\n\nComplications\nComplications depend on the types of signs and symptoms you have. For example, overly flexible joints can result in joint dislocations and early-onset arthritis. Fragile skin may develop prominent scarring.\n\n\nPeople who have vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome are at risk of often fatal ruptures of major blood vessels. Some organs, such as the uterus and intestines, also may rupture. Pregnancy can increase the risk of a rupture in the uterus.\n\n\nPrevention\nIf you have a personal or family history of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and you're thinking about starting a family, you may benefit from talking to a genetic counselor \u2014 a health care professional trained to assess the risk of inherited disorders. Genetic counseling can help you understand the inheritance pattern of the type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome that affects you and the risks it poses for your children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff"

  "symptoms": "Normally when you blink, your eyelids distribute tears evenly across your eyes, keeping the surfaces of the eyes lubricated. These tears drain into small openings on the inner part of your eyelids (puncta).\n\n\nIf you have ectropion, your lower lid pulls away from your eye and tears don't drain properly into the puncta. The resulting signs and symptoms can include:\n\n\n\nWatery eyes (excessive tearing). Without proper drainage, your tears may pool and constantly flow over your eyelids.\nExcessive dryness. Ectropion can cause your eyes to feel dry, gritty and sandy.\nIrritation. Stagnant tears or dryness can irritate your eyes, causing a burning sensation and redness in your eyelids and the whites of your eyes.\nSensitivity to light. Stagnant tears or dry eyes can irritate the surface of the cornea, making you sensitive to light."

  "title": "Eating disorders",
  "symptoms": "Symptoms vary, depending on the type of eating disorder. Anorexia, bulimia and binge-eating disorder are the most common eating disorders. People with eating disorders can have all different body types and sizes.\n\n\nAnorexia\nAnorexia (an-o-REK-see-uh), also called anorexia nervosa, can be a life-threatening eating disorder. It includes an unhealthy low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight, and a view of weight and shape that is not realistic. Anorexia often involves using extreme efforts to control weight and shape, which often seriously interfere with health and daily life.\n\n\nAnorexia may include severely limiting calories or cutting out certain kinds of foods or food groups. It may involve other methods to lose weight, such as exercising too much, using laxatives or diet aids, or vomiting after eating. Efforts to reduce weight can cause severe health problems, even for those who continue eating throughout the day or whose weight isn't extremely low.\n\n\nBulimia\nBulimia (buh-LEE-me-uh), also called bulimia nervosa, is a serious, sometimes life-threatening eating disorder. Bulimia includes episodes of bingeing, commonly followed by episodes of purging. Sometimes bulimia also includes severely limiting eating for periods of time. This often leads to stronger urges to binge eat and then purge.\n\n\nBingeing involves eating food \u2014 sometimes an extremely large amount \u2014 in a short period of time. During bingeing, people feel like they have no control over their eating and that they can't stop. After eating, due to guilt, shame or an intense fear of weight gain, purging is done to get rid of calories. Purging can include vomiting, exercising too much, not eating for a period of time, or using other methods, such as taking laxatives. Some people change medicine doses, such as changing insulin amounts, to try to lose weight.\n\n\nBulimia also involves being preoccupied with weight and body shape, with severe and harsh self-judgment of personal appearance.\n\n\nBinge-eating disorder\nBinge-eating disorder involves eating food in a short amount of time. When bingeing, it feels like there's no control over eating. But binge eating is not followed by purging. During a binge, people may eat food faster or eat more food than planned. Even when not hungry, eating may continue long past feeling uncomfortably full.\n\n\nAfter a binge, people often feel a great deal of guilt, disgust or shame. They may fear gaining weight. They may try to severely limit eating for periods of time. This leads to increased urges to binge, setting up an unhealthy cycle. Embarrassment can lead to eating alone to hide bingeing. A new round of bingeing commonly occurs at least once a week.\n\n\nAvoidant/restrictive food intake disorder\nAvoidant/restrictive food intake disorder includes extremely limited eating or not eating certain foods. The pattern of eating often doesn't meet minimum daily nutrition needs. This may lead to problems with growth, development and functioning in daily life. But people with this disorder don't have fears about gaining weight or body size. Instead, they may not be interested in eating or may avoid food with a certain color, texture, smell or taste. Or they may worry about what can happen when eating. For example, they may have a fear of choking or vomiting, or they may worry about getting stomach problems.\n\n\nAvoidant/restrictive food intake disorder can be diagnosed in all ages, but it's more common in younger children. The disorder can result in major weight loss or failure to gain weight in childhood. A lack of proper nutrition can lead to major health problems."

  "title": "Gender dysphoria",
  "symptoms": "Gender dysphoria might cause adolescents and adults to experience a marked difference between inner gender identity and assigned gender that lasts for at least six months. The difference is shown by at least two of the following: \n\n\n\nA difference between gender identity and genitals or secondary sex characteristics, such as breast size, voice and facial hair. In young adolescents, a difference between gender identity and anticipated secondary sex characteristics.\nA strong desire to be rid of these genitals or secondary sex characteristics, or a desire to prevent the development of secondary sex characteristics.\nA strong desire to have the genitals and secondary sex characteristics of another gender.\nA strong desire to be or to be treated as another gender.\nA strong belief of having the typical feelings and reactions of another gender.\n\n\n\nGender dysphoria may also cause significant distress that affects how you function in social situations, at work or school, and in other areas of life.\n\n\nGender dysphoria might start in childhood and continue into adolescence and adulthood. Or you might have periods in which you no longer experience gender dysphoria. You might also experience gender dysphoria around the time of puberty or much later in life.\n\n\nComplications\nGender dysphoria can affect many aspects of life, including daily activities. People experiencing gender dysphoria might have difficulty in school due to pressure to dress in a way that's associated with their sex assigned at birth or out of fear of being harassed or teased.\n\n\nIf gender dysphoria impairs the ability to function at school or at work, the result may be school dropout or unemployment. Relationship difficulties are common. Anxiety, depression, self-harm, eating disorders, substance misuse and other problems can occur.\n\n\nPeople who have gender dysphoria also often experience discrimination, resulting in stress. Accessing health services and mental health services can be difficult due to fear of stigma and a lack of experienced care providers.\n\n\nAdolescents and adults with gender dysphoria without gender-affirming treatment might be at risk of thinking about or attempting suicide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff"

Because the liver and especially the spleen can enlarge dramatically, the abdomen can become painfully distended.\nSkeletal abnormalities. Gaucher disease can weaken bone, increasing the risk of painful fractures. It can also interfere with the blood supply to your bones, which can cause portions of the bone to die.\nBlood disorders. A decrease in healthy red blood cells (anemia) can result in severe fatigue. Gaucher disease also affects the cells responsible for clotting, which can cause easy bruising and nosebleeds.\n\n\n\nMore rarely, Gaucher disease affects the brain, which can cause abnormal eye movements, muscle rigidity, swallowing difficulties and seizures. One rare subtype of Gaucher disease begins in infancy and typically results in death by 2 years of age."

Malformed veins may become more prominent with age.\nOvergrowth of bones and soft tissue. This begins in infancy and may be limited to one leg, but it can occur in an arm or, rarely, in the trunk or face. This overgrowth of bone and tissue creates a larger and longer extremity. Rarely, there may be fusion of fingers or toes or extra fingers or toes.\nLymphatic system malformations. The lymphatic system \u2014 part of the immune system that protects against infection and disease and transports lymphatic fluid \u2014 can be malformed.

  "title": "Dwarfism",
  "symptoms": "Signs and symptoms \u2014 other than short stature \u2014 vary considerably across the spectrum of disorders.\n\n\nDisproportionate dwarfism\nMost people with dwarfism have disorders that cause disproportionately short stature. Usually, this means that a person has an average-size trunk and very short limbs, but some people may have a very short trunk and shortened (but disproportionately large) limbs. In these disorders, the head is disproportionately large compared with the body.\n\n\nAlmost all people with disproportionate dwarfism have normal intellectual capacities. Rare exceptions are usually the result of a secondary factor, such as excess fluid around the brain (hydrocephalus).\n\n\nThe most common cause of dwarfism is a disorder called achondroplasia, which causes disproportionately short stature. This disorder usually results in the following:\n\n\n\nAn average-size trunk\nShort arms and legs, with particularly short upper arms and upper legs\nShort fingers, often with a wide separation between the middle and ring fingers\nLimited mobility at the elbows\nA disproportionately large head, with a prominent forehead and a flattened bridge of the nose\nProgressive development of bowed legs\nProgressive development of swayed lower back\nAn adult height around 4 feet (122 cm)\n\n\n\nAnother cause of disproportionate dwarfism is a rare disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC). Signs may include:\n\n\n\nA very short trunk\nA short neck\nShortened arms and legs\nAverage-size hands and feet\nBroad, rounded chest\nSlightly flattened cheekbones\nOpening in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate)\nHip deformities that result in thighbones turning inward\nA foot that's twisted or out of shape\nInstability of the neck bones\nProgressive hunching curvature of the upper spine\nProgressive development of swayed lower back\nVision and hearing problems\nArthritis and problems with joint movement\nAdult height ranging from 3 feet (91 cm) to just over 4 feet (122 cm)\n\n\n\nProportionate dwarfism\nProportionate dwarfism results from medical conditions present at birth or appearing in early childhood that limit overall growth and development. So the head, trunk and limbs are all small, but they're proportionate to each other. Because these disorders affect overall growth, many of them result in poor development of one or more body systems.\n\n\nGrowth hormone deficiency is a relatively common cause of proportionate dwarfism. It occurs when the pituitary gland fails to produce an adequate supply of growth hormone, which is essential for normal childhood growth. Signs include:\n\n\n\nHeight below the third percentile on standard pediatric growth charts\nGrowth rate slower than expected for age\nDelayed or no sexual development during the teen years"

  "symptoms": "Symptoms depend on the type of dissociative disorder, but may include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA sense of being separated from yourself and your emotions.\nThinking that people and things around you are distorted and not real.\nA blurred sense of your own identity.\nSevere stress or problems in relationships, work or other important areas of life.\nNot being able to cope well with emotional or work-related stress.\nMemory loss, also called amnesia, of certain time periods, events, people and personal information.\nMental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors.\n\n\n\nThe American Psychiatric Association defines three major dissociative disorders: Depersonalization/derealization disorder, dissociative amnesia, and dissociative identity disorder.\n\n\nDepersonalization/derealization disorder\nDepersonalization involves a sense of separation from yourself or feeling like you're outside of yourself. You may feel as if you're seeing your actions, feelings, thoughts and self from a distance, like you're watching a movie.\n\n\nDerealization involves feeling that other people and things are separate from you and seem foggy or dreamlike. Time may seem to slow down or speed up. The world may seem unreal.\n\n\nYou may go through depersonalization, derealization or both. Symptoms, which can be very distressing, may last hours, days, weeks or months. They may come and go over many years. Or they may become ongoing.\n\n\nDissociative amnesia\nThe main symptom of dissociative amnesia is memory loss that's more severe than usual forgetfulness. The memory loss can't be explained by a medical condition. You can't recall information about yourself or events and people in your life, especially from a time when you felt shock, distress or pain. A bout of dissociative amnesia usually occurs suddenly. It may last minutes, hours, or rarely, months or years.\n\n\nDissociative amnesia can be specific to events in a certain time, such as intense combat. More rarely, it can involve complete loss of memory about yourself. It sometimes may involve travel or confused wandering away from your life. This confused wandering is called dissociative fugue.\n\n\nDissociative identity disorder\nFormerly known as multiple personality disorder, this disorder involves \"switching\" to other identities. You may feel as if you have two or more people talking or living inside your head. You may feel like you're possessed by other identities.\n\n\nEach identity may have a unique name, personal history and features. These identities sometimes include differences in voice, gender, mannerisms and even such physical qualities as the need for eyeglasses. There also are differences in how familiar each identity is with the others. Dissociative identity disorder usually also includes bouts of amnesia and often includes times of confused wandering."

Ketones are a byproduct of the breakdown of muscle and fat that happens when there's not enough available insulin.\nFeeling tired and weak.\nFeeling irritable or having other mood changes.\nHaving blurry vision.\nHaving slow-healing sores.\nGetting a lot of infections, such as gum, skin and vaginal infections.\n\n\n\nType 1 diabetes can start at any age. But it often starts during childhood or teen years. Type 2 diabetes, the more common type, can develop at any age. Type 2 diabetes is more common in people older than 40.

Or they may seem like they only have two dimensions, so they're flat with no depth. Or you could be more aware of your surroundings, and they may appear clearer than usual.\nThoughts about time that are not real, such as recent events feeling like the distant past.\nUnrealistic thoughts about distance and the size and shape of objects.\n\n\n\nBouts of depersonalization-derealization disorder may last hours, days, weeks or months.

Signs and symptoms get progressively worse over time, usually over years.\n\n\nClusters of symptom types tend to occur together, and people may have more than one cluster of symptom types.\n\n\nBehavioral changes\nThe most common signs of frontotemporal dementia involve extreme changes in behavior and personality. These include:\n\n\n\nIncreasingly inappropriate social behavior\nLoss of empathy and other interpersonal skills, such as having sensitivity to another's feelings\nLack of judgment\nLoss of inhibition\nLack of interest (apathy), which can be mistaken for depression\nRepetitive compulsive behavior, such as tapping, clapping or smacking lips\nA decline in personal hygiene\nChanges in eating habits, usually overeating or developing a preference for sweets and carbohydrates\nEating inedible objects\nCompulsively wanting to put things in the mouth\n\n\n\nSpeech and language problems\nSome subtypes of frontotemporal dementia lead to language problems or impairment or loss of speech. Primary progressive aphasia, semantic dementia and progressive agrammatic (nonfluent) aphasia are all considered to be frontotemporal dementia.\n\n\nProblems caused by these conditions include:\n\n\n\nIncreasing difficulty in using and understanding written and spoken language, such as having trouble finding the right word to use in speech or naming objects\nTrouble naming things, possibly replacing a specific word with a more general word such as \"it\" for pen\nNo longer knowing word meanings\nHaving hesitant speech that may sound telegraphic\nMaking mistakes in sentence construction\n\n\n\nMotor disorders\nRarer subtypes of frontotemporal dementia are characterized by problems with movement similar to those associated with Parkinson's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\n\nMotor-related problems may include:\n\n\n\nTremor\nRigidity\nMuscle spasms or twitches\nPoor coordination\nDifficulty swallowing\nMuscle weakness\nInappropriate laughing or crying\nFalls or walking problems\n\n\n\nCauses\nIn frontotemporal dementia, the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain shrink. In addition, certain substances accumulate in the brain. What causes these changes is usually unknown.\n\n\nThere are genetic mutations that have been linked to frontotemporal dementia. But more than half of the people who develop frontotemporal dementia have no family history of dementia.\n\n\nRecently, researchers have confirmed shared genetics and molecular pathways between frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

There may be periods of no symptoms. Symptoms tend to be worse at night when it's dark and things look less familiar. They also tend to be worse in settings that aren't familiar, such as in a hospital.\n\n\nPrimary symptoms include the following.\n\n\nReduced awareness of surroundings\nThis may result in:\n\n\n\nTrouble focusing on a topic or changing topics\nGetting stuck on an idea rather than responding to questions\nBeing easily distracted\nBeing withdrawn, with little or no activity or little response to surroundings\n\n\n\nPoor thinking skills\nThis may appear as:\n\n\n\nPoor memory, such as forgetting recent events\nNot knowing where they are or who they are\nTrouble with speech or recalling words\nRambling or nonsense speech\nTrouble understanding speech\nTrouble reading or writing\n\n\n\nBehavior and emotional changes\nThese may include:\n\n\n\nAnxiety, fear or distrust of others\nDepression\nA short temper or anger\nA sense of feeling elated\nLack of interest and emotion\nQuick changes in mood\nPersonality changes\nSeeing things that others don't see\nBeing restless, anxious or combative\nCalling out, moaning or making other sounds\nBeing quiet and withdrawn \u2014 especially in older adults\nSlowed movement or being sluggish\nChanges in sleep habits\nA switched night-day sleep-wake cycle\n\n\n\nTypes of delirium\nExperts have identified three types:\n\n\n\nHyperactive delirium. This may be the easiest type to recognize. People with this type may be restless and pace the room. They also may be anxious, have rapid mood swings or see things that aren't there. People with this type often resist care.\nHypoactive delirium. People with this type may be inactive or have reduced activity. They tend to be sluggish or drowsy. They might seem to be in a daze. They don't interact with family or others.\nMixed delirium. Symptoms involve both types of delirium. The person may quickly switch back and forth from being restless and sluggish.\n\n\n\nDelirium and dementia\nDelirium and dementia may be hard to tell apart, and a person may have both. Someone with dementia has a gradual decline of memory and other thinking skills due to damage or loss of brain cells. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, which comes on slowly over months or years.\n\n\nDelirium often occurs in people with dementia. However, episodes of delirium don't always mean a person has dementia. Tests for dementia shouldn't be done during a delirium episode because the results could be misleading.\n\n\nSome differences between the symptoms of delirium and dementia include:\n\n\n\nOnset. The onset of delirium occurs within a short time \u2014 within a day or two. Dementia usually begins with minor symptoms that get worse over time.\nAttention. The ability to stay focused or maintain focus is impaired with delirium. A person in the early stages of dementia remains generally alert. Someone with dementia often isn't sluggish or agitated.\nRapid changes in symptoms. Delirium symptoms can come and go several times during the day. While people with dementia have better and worse times of day, their memory and thinking skills typically stay at a constant level."

When changes in your thinking and reasoning seem clearly linked to a stroke, this condition is sometimes called post-stroke dementia.Sometimes a characteristic pattern of vascular dementia symptoms follows a series of strokes or ministrokes. Changes in your thought processes occur in noticeable steps downward from your previous level of function, unlike the gradual, steady decline that typically occurs in Alzheimer's disease dementia.But vascular dementia can also develop very gradually, just like Alzheimer's disease dementia.

Some septal deformities, however, may cause the following signs and symptoms:\nObstruction of one or both nostrils. This blockage can make it difficult to breathe through the nostril or nostrils. You may notice this more when you have a cold or allergies that can cause your nasal passages to swell and narrow.\nNosebleeds. The surface of your nasal septum may become dry, increasing your risk of nosebleeds.\nFacial pain. There is some debate about the possible nasal causes of facial pain. A possible cause of one-sided facial pain could be a severe deviated septum in which surfaces within the nose touch and cause pressure.\nNoisy breathing during sleep. A deviated septum or swelling of the tissues in your nose can be one of the many reasons for noisy breathing during sleep.\nAwareness of the nasal cycle. The nose alternates between being obstructed on one side and then changes to being obstructed on the other. This is called the nasal cycle. Being aware of the nasal cycle isn't typical and can indicate nasal obstruction.\nPreference for sleeping on a particular side. Some people may prefer to sleep on a particular side to optimize breathing through the nose at night if one nasal passage is narrowed."

  "title": "Narcolepsy",
  "symptoms": "The symptoms of narcolepsy may get worse during the first few years of the disorder. Then they continue for life. They include:\n\n\n\n\nExcessive daytime sleepiness. People with narcolepsy fall asleep without warning. It can happen anywhere and at any time. It may happen when you're bored or during a task. For example, you may be working or talking with friends and suddenly fall asleep. It can be especially dangerous if you fall asleep while driving. You might fall asleep for only a few minutes or up to a half-hour. After waking, you'll often feel refreshed but you'll get sleepy again.\nYou also may experience a decrease in how alert and focused you feel during the day. Daytime sleepiness often is the first symptom to appear. Feeling sleepy makes it hard to focus and function.\nSome people with narcolepsy continue doing a task when they fall asleep briefly. For example, you may fall asleep while writing, typing or driving. You might continue to perform that task while asleep. When you awaken, you can't remember what you did, and you probably didn't do it well.\n\n\nSudden loss of muscle tone. This condition is called cataplexy. It can cause slurred speech or complete weakness of most muscles. Symptoms may last up to a few minutes.\nCataplexy can't be controlled. It's triggered by intense emotions. Often the emotions that cause cataplexy are positive. Laughter or excitement may cause the symptoms. But sometimes fear, surprise or anger can cause the loss of muscle tone. For example, when you laugh, your head may drop without your control. Or your knees may suddenly lose strength, causing you to fall.\nSome people with narcolepsy experience only one or two episodes of cataplexy a year. Others have several episodes a day. Not everyone with narcolepsy has these symptoms.\n\n\nSleep paralysis. People with narcolepsy often experience sleep paralysis. During sleep paralysis, you can't move or speak while falling asleep or upon waking. It's usually brief \u2014 lasting a few seconds or minutes. But it can be scary. You may be aware of it happening and can recall it afterward.\nNot everyone with sleep paralysis has narcolepsy.\n\nHallucinations. Sometimes people see things that aren't there during sleep paralysis. Hallucinations also may happen in bed without sleep paralysis. These are called hypnagogic hallucinations if they happen as you fall asleep. They're called hypnopompic hallucinations if they happen upon waking. For example, you might feel as if there is a stranger in your bedroom. These hallucinations may be vivid and frightening because you may not be fully asleep when you begin dreaming.\nChanges in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. REM sleep is when most dreaming happens. Typically, people enter REM sleep 60 to 90 minutes after falling asleep. But people with narcolepsy often move more quickly to REM sleep. They tend to enter REM sleep within 15 minutes of falling asleep. REM sleep also can happen at any time of the day.\n\n\n\nOther characteristics\nPeople with narcolepsy may have other sleep disorders. They might have obstructive sleep apnea, in which breathing starts and stops during the night. Or they may act out their dreams, known as REM sleep behavior disorder. Or they may have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, called insomnia."

  "title": "Delayed ejaculation",
  "symptoms": "Some men with delayed ejaculation need 30 minutes or more of sexual stimulation to have an orgasm and ejaculate. Other men might not be able to ejaculate at all (anejaculation).\n\n\nBut, there's no specific time that indicates a diagnosis of delayed ejaculation. Instead, you are probably experiencing delayed ejaculation if the delay is causing distress or frustration, or if you have to stop sexual activity due to fatigue, physical irritation, loss of erection or a request from your partner.\n\n\nOften, men might have difficulty reaching orgasm during sexual intercourse or other sexual activities with a partner. Some men can ejaculate only when masturbating.\n\n\nDelayed ejaculation is divided into the following types based on symptoms:\n\n\n\nLifelong vs. acquired. With lifelong delayed ejaculation, the problem is present from the time of sexual maturity. Acquired delayed ejaculation occurs after a period of normal sexual functioning.\nGeneralized vs. situational. Generalized delayed ejaculation isn't limited to certain sex partners or certain kinds of stimulation. Situational delayed ejaculation occurs only under certain circumstances.\n\n\n\nThese categories help in diagnosing an underlying cause and determining what might be the most effective treatment."

  "symptoms": "A tumor is an abnormal growth or mass of tissue. A cyst is a lesion that contains liquid or semisolid material. Examples of jaw tumors and cysts include:\n\n\n\nAmeloblastoma. This rare, usually noncancerous (benign) tumor begins in the cells that form the protective enamel lining on the teeth. It develops most often in the jaw near the molars. The most common type is aggressive, forming large tumors and growing into the jawbone. Although this tumor can recur after treatment, aggressive surgical treatment will typically reduce the chance of recurrence.\nCentral giant cell granuloma. Central giant cell granulomas are benign lesions that grow from bone cells. They most often occur in the front portion of the lower jaw. One type of these tumors can grow rapidly, cause pain and destroy bone, and has a tendency to recur after surgical treatment. The other type is less aggressive and may not have symptoms. Rarely, a tumor may shrink or resolve on its own, but typically these tumors require surgical treatment.\nDentigerous cyst. This cyst originates from tissue that surrounds a tooth before it erupts into the mouth. This is the most common form of cyst that affects the jaws. Most often these cysts will occur around wisdom teeth that are not fully erupted, but they can also involve other teeth.\nOdontogenic keratocyst. This cyst is also referred to as a keratocystic odontogenic tumor because of its tumorlike tendency to recur after surgical treatment. Although this cyst is typically slow growing, it can still be destructive to the jaw and teeth if left untreated over a long period of time. Most often the cyst develops in the lower jaw near the third molars. These cysts may also be found in people with an inherited condition called nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.\nOdontogenic myxoma. This is a rare, slow-growing, benign tumor that occurs most often in the lower jaw. The tumor can be large and aggressively invade the jaw and surrounding tissue and displace teeth. Odontogenic myxomas are known to recur after surgical treatment; however, the chances of tumor recurrence are typically lessened by more-aggressive forms of surgical treatment.\nOdontoma. This benign tumor is the most common odontogenic tumor. Odontomas often have no symptoms, but they may interfere with tooth development or eruption. Odontomas are made up of dental tissue that grows around a tooth in the jaw. They can resemble an oddly shaped tooth or can be a small or large calcified tumor. These tumors may be part of some genetic syndromes.\nOther types of cysts and tumors. These include adenomatoid odontogenic tumor, calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor, glandular odontogenic cyst, squamous odontogenic tumor, calcifying odontogenic cyst, cementoblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, ossifying fibroma, osteoblastoma. central odontogenic fibroma and others."

  "symptoms": "The symptoms of hypopituitarism usually start slowly and get worse over time. They might not be noticed for months or even years. But for some people, symptoms start suddenly.\n\n\nSymptoms of hypopituitarism vary from person to person. Symptoms depend on what hormones are missing and how little of the hormone is being made. There might be more than one hormone that's low. A second hormone deficiency might increase the symptoms of the first one. Or sometimes, it might hide those symptoms.\n\n\nGrowth hormone (GH) deficiency\nIn children, GH deficiency can cause growth problems and short stature. Most adults who have GH deficiency don't have symptoms. But some adults have:\n\n\n\nFatigue.\nMuscle weakness.\nChanges in body fat.\nLoss of interest in activities.\nLack of social contacts.\n\n\n\nLuteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) deficiency\nA lack of these hormones, called gonadotropins, affects the reproductive system.\n\n\nThe lack of hormones keeps the ovaries from making enough eggs and estrogen. It keeps the testicles from making enough sperm and testosterone. This can lower sex drive and cause tiredness. It also can make it hard or impossible to have children \u2014 a condition called infertility. In children, the physical changes to an adult body, known as puberty, may not occur or may be late.\n\n\nSome people might have symptoms such as:\n\n\n\nHot flashes.\nIrregular periods or no periods.\nLoss of pubic hair.\nNot being able to make milk for breastfeeding.\nNot being able to get or keep an erection, known as erectile dysfunction.\nDecreased facial or body hair.\nMood changes.\nFatigue.\n\n\n\nThyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiency\nThis hormone controls the thyroid gland. Too little TSH leads to low levels of thyroid hormones. This condition is called hypothyroidism. It causes symptoms such as:\n\n\n\nTiredness.\nWeight gain.\nDry skin.\nConstipation.\nSensitivity to cold or trouble staying warm.\n\n\n\nAdrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency\nThis hormone helps the adrenal glands work correctly. It also helps the body react to stress. Symptoms of ACTH deficiency include:\n\n\n\nSevere tiredness.\nLow blood pressure.\nMany and lasting infections.\nNausea, vomiting or abdominal pain.\nConfusion.\n\n\n\nAnti-diuretic hormone (ADH) deficiency\nThis hormone, which also is called vasopressin, helps the body balance its fluid levels. An ADH deficiency can lead to a disorder called diabetes insipidus, which can cause:\n\n\n\nUrinating more than usual.\nExtreme thirst.\nImbalances in minerals such as sodium and potassium, known as electrolytes.\n\n\n\nProlactin deficiency\nProlactin is the hormone that tells the body when to start making breast milk.

  "title": "HPV infection",
  "symptoms": "SymptomsIn most cases, your body's immune system defeats an HPV infection before it creates warts. When warts do appear, they vary in appearance depending on which kind of HPV is involved:\n Genital warts. These appear as flat lesions, small cauliflower-like bumps or tiny stemlike protrusions. In women, genital warts appear mostly on the vulva but can also occur near the anus, on the cervix or in the vagina. In men, genital warts appear on the penis and scrotum or around the anus. Genital warts rarely cause discomfort or pain, though they may itch or feel tender. \nCommon warts. Common warts appear as rough, raised bumps and usually occur on the hands and fingers. In most cases, common warts are simply unsightly, but they can also be painful or susceptible to injury or bleeding.\nPlantar warts. Plantar warts are hard, grainy growths that usually appear on the heels or balls of your feet. These warts might cause discomfort.\nFlat warts. Flat warts are flat-topped, slightly raised lesions. They can appear anywhere, but children usually get them on the face and men tend to get them in the beard area. Women tend to get them on the legs.\nCommon warts\n        Common warts can grow on your hands or fingers. They're small, grainy bumps that are rough to the touch.\n        Plantar warts\n        Plantar warts are caused by the same type of virus that causes warts on your hands and fingers. But, because of their location, they can be painful.\n        Flat warts\n        Flat warts are smaller and smoother than other warts. They generally occur on the face or legs and are more common in children and teens than in adults.\n        Female genital warts\n        Genital warts are a common sexually transmitted infection. They can appear on the genitals, in the pubic area or in the anal canal. In women, genital warts can also grow inside the vagina.\n        Male genital warts\n        Genital warts are a common sexually transmitted infection. They can appear on the genitals, in the pubic area or in the anal canal.\n        Cervical cancerNearly all cervical cancers are caused by HPV infections, but cervical cancer may take 20 years or longer to develop after an HPV infection. The HPV infection and early cervical cancer typically don't cause noticeable symptoms. Getting vaccinated against HPV infection is your best protection from cervical cancer.Because early cervical cancer doesn't cause symptoms, it's vital that women have regular screening tests to detect any precancerous changes in the cervix that might lead to cancer. Current guidelines recommend that women ages 21 to 29 have a Pap test every three years.Women ages 30 to 65 are advised to continue having a Pap test every three years, or every five years if they also get the HPV DNA test at the same time. Women over 65 can stop testing if they've had three normal Pap tests in a row, or two HPV DNA and Pap tests with no abnormal results."

  "symptoms": "Common symptoms of hemifacial spasm include jerking of muscles in the face that are most often:\n\n\n\nOn one side of the face.\nNot controllable.\nPainless.\n\n\n\nThese muscle movements, also called contractions, often start in the eyelid. Then they might move on to the cheek and mouth on the same side of the face. At first, hemifacial spasms come and go. But over months to years, they occur almost all the time.\n\n\nSometimes, hemifacial spasms occur on both sides of the face. However, the twitching doesn't occur on both sides of the face at the same time.\n\n\nCauses\nA blood vessel touching a facial nerve is the most common cause of hemifacial spasm. A facial nerve injury or a tumor also can cause it. Sometimes the cause isn't known.\n\n\nHemifacial spasm sometimes starts as a result of:\n\n\n\nMoving the muscles in the face.\nAnxiety.\nStress.\nBeing tired.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff"

  "symptoms": "SymptomsAdults usually develop heat rash in skin folds and where clothing rubs against the skin. In infants, the rash is mainly found on the neck, shoulders and chest. It can also show up in the armpits, elbow creases and groin.Sweat glands\n        Eccrine sweat glands occur over most of the body and open directly onto the skin's surface. Apocrine glands open into the hair follicle, leading to the surface of the skin. Apocrine glands develop in areas with many hair follicles, such as on the scalp, armpits and groin. Eccrine sweat glands are involved in hyperhidrosis, though apocrine glands may play a role as well.\n        Types of heat rashThe types of heat rash are classified according to how deep the sweat is trapped in the skin. Signs and symptoms for each type vary.\nThe mildest form of heat rash is called miliaria crystallina. It occurs when the opening of the sweat duct on the surface of the skin (sweat pore) is blocked. This form is marked by tiny, clear, fluid-filled bumps that break easily.\nA type that occurs deeper in the skin is called miliaria rubra. It is sometimes called prickly heat. Signs and symptoms include small, inflamed blister-like bumps and itching or prickling in the affected area.\nOccasionally, the inflamed bumps of miliaria rubra fill with pus. This form is called miliaria pustulosa.\nA less common form of heat rash is called miliaria profunda. It affects the deepest layer of the skin (dermis). It causes firm, painful or itchy inflamed bumps that look like goose bumps and may break open."

Sometimes pulling hairs from pets or dolls or from materials, such as clothes or blankets, may be a sign. Most people with trichotillomania pull hair in private and generally try to hide the disorder from others.\n\n\nFor people with trichotillomania, hair pulling can be:\n\n\n\nFocused. Some people pull their hair intentionally to relieve tension or distress \u2014 for example, pulling hair out to get relief from the overwhelming urge to pull hair. Some people may develop elaborate rituals for pulling hair, such as finding just the right hair or biting pulled hairs.\nAutomatic. Some people pull their hair without even realizing they're doing it, such as when they're bored, reading or watching TV.\n\n\n\nThe same person may do both focused and automatic hair pulling, depending on the situation and mood. Certain positions or rituals may trigger hair pulling, such as resting your head on your hand or brushing your hair.\n\n\nTrichotillomania can be related to emotions:\n\n\n\nNegative emotions. For many people with trichotillomania, hair pulling is a way of dealing with negative or uncomfortable feelings, such as stress, anxiety, tension, boredom, loneliness, fatigue or frustration.\nPositive feelings. People with trichotillomania often find that pulling out hair feels satisfying and provides a measure of relief. As a result, they continue to pull their hair to maintain these positive feelings.\n\n\n\nTrichotillomania is a long-term (chronic) disorder. Without treatment, symptoms can vary in severity over time. For example, the hormonal changes of menstruation can worsen symptoms in women. For some people, if not treated, symptoms can come and go for weeks, months or years at a time. Rarely, hair pulling ends within a few years of starting."

These are called stingers or burners, and can produce the following symptoms:\n\n\n\nA feeling like an electric shock or a burning sensation shooting down the arm\nNumbness and weakness in the arm\n\n\n\nThese symptoms usually last only a few seconds or minutes, but in some people the symptoms may linger for days or longer.\n\n\nMore-severe injuries\nMore-severe symptoms result from injuries that seriously hurt or even tear or rupture the nerves. The most serious brachial plexus injury occurs when the nerve root is torn from the spinal cord.\n\n\nSigns and symptoms of more-severe injuries can include:\n\n\n\nWeakness or inability to use certain muscles in the hand, arm or shoulder\nComplete lack of movement and feeling in the arm, including the shoulder and hand\nSevere pain"

Bone spurs in your knee can make it painful to extend and bend your leg.\nSpine. On your vertebrae, bone spurs can narrow the space that contains your spinal cord. These bone spurs can pinch the spinal cord or its nerve roots and can cause weakness or numbness in your arms or legs.\nHip. Bone spurs can make it painful to move your hip, although you might feel the pain in your knee. Depending on their placement, bone spurs can reduce the range of motion in your hip joint."

Even in the same person, symptoms may worsen or improve as time passes. Some people may not experience symptoms until their teenage years or adulthood. People who are not diagnosed until adulthood usually have milder disease and are more likely to have atypical symptoms, such as recurring bouts of an inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis), infertility and recurring pneumonia.\n\n\nPeople with cystic fibrosis have a higher than normal level of salt in their sweat. Parents often can taste the salt when they kiss their children. Most of the other signs and symptoms of CF affect the respiratory system and digestive system.\n\n\nRespiratory signs and symptoms\nThe thick and sticky mucus associated with cystic fibrosis clogs the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. This can cause signs and symptoms such as:\n\n\n\nA persistent cough that produces thick mucus (sputum)\nWheezing\nExercise intolerance\nRepeated lung infections\nInflamed nasal passages or a stuffy nose\nRecurrent sinusitis\n\n\n\nDigestive signs and symptoms\nThe thick mucus can also block tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your small intestine.

  "title": "Bladder exstrophy",
  "symptoms": "Bladder exstrophy is the most common in the larger group of birth defects called the bladder exstrophy-epispadias complex (BEEC). Children with BEEC have one of the following:\n\n\n\nEpispadias. This is the least severe form of BEEC, in which the tube to expel urine (urethra) doesn't fully develop.\n\nBladder exstrophy. This defect causes the bladder to form on the outside of the body. The bladder is also turned inside out. Usually, bladder exstrophy will involve organs of the urinary tract, as well as the digestive and reproductive systems. Defects of the abdominal wall, bladder, genitals, pelvic bones, final section of the large intestine (rectum) and opening at the end of the rectum (anus) can occur.\nChildren with bladder exstrophy also have vesicoureteral reflux. This condition causes urine to flow the wrong way \u2014 from the bladder back up into the tubes that connect to the kidneys (ureters). Children with bladder exstrophy also have epispadias.\n\n\nCloacal exstrophy. Cloacal exstrophy (kloe-A-kul EK-stroh-fee) is the most serious form of BEEC. In this condition, the rectum, bladder and genitals don't fully separate as the fetus develops. These organs may not be correctly formed, and the pelvic bones are affected as well.\nThe kidneys, backbone and spinal cord also may be affected. Most children with cloacal exstrophy have spinal abnormalities, including spina bifida. Children born with protruding abdominal organs probably also have cloacal exstrophy or bladder exstrophy."

  "title": "Bipolar disorder",
  "symptoms": "There are several types of bipolar and related disorders. They may include mania or hypomania and depression. Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life.\n\n\n\nBipolar I disorder. You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis).\nBipolar II disorder. You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode.\nCyclothymic disorder. You've had at least two years \u2014 or one year in children and teenagers \u2014 of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression).\nOther types. These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke.\n\n\n\nBipolar II disorder is not a milder form of bipolar I disorder, but a separate diagnosis. While the manic episodes of bipolar I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with bipolar II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment.\n\n\nAlthough bipolar disorder can occur at any age, typically it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s. Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time.\n\n\nMania and hypomania\nMania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms. Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as relationship difficulties. Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization.\n\n\nBoth a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms:\n\n\n\nAbnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired\nIncreased activity, energy or agitation\nExaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria)\nDecreased need for sleep\nUnusual talkativeness\nRacing thoughts\nDistractibility\nPoor decision-making \u2014 for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments\n\n\n\nMajor depressive episode\nA major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause noticeable difficulty in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships. An episode includes five or more of these symptoms:\n\n\n\nDepressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless or tearful (in children and teens, depressed mood can appear as irritability)\nMarked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all \u2014 or almost all \u2014 activities\nSignificant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected can be a sign of depression)\nEither insomnia or sleeping too much\nEither restlessness or slowed behavior\nFatigue or loss of energy\nFeelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt\nDecreased ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness\nThinking about, planning or attempting suicide\n\n\n\nOther features of bipolar disorder\nSigns and symptoms of bipolar I and bipolar II disorders may include other features, such as anxious distress, melancholy, psychosis or others. The timing of symptoms may include diagnostic labels such as mixed or rapid cycling. In addition, bipolar symptoms may occur during pregnancy or change with the seasons.\n\n\nSymptoms in children and teens\nSymptoms of bipolar disorder can be difficult to identify in children and teens. It's often hard to tell whether these are normal ups and downs, the results of stress or trauma, or signs of a mental health problem other than bipolar disorder.\n\n\nChildren and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes, but the pattern can vary from that of adults with bipolar disorder. And moods can rapidly shift during episodes. Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes.\n\n\nThe most prominent signs of bipolar disorder in children and teenagers may include severe mood swings that are different from their usual mood swings."

  "symptoms": "If the bicuspid valve causes severe aortic stenosis or severe aortic regurgitation, symptoms may include:\n\n\n\nChest pain.\nShortness of breath.\nDifficulty exercising.\nFainting or near fainting.\n\n\n\nMost people with bicuspid aortic valve don't have symptoms of heart valve disease until they're adults. But some infants may have severe symptoms.\n\n\nDiagnosis\nA bicuspid aortic valve may be found when tests are done for another health problem. The health care provider may hear a heart murmur when listening to the heart.\n\n\nAn echocardiogram can confirm a diagnosis of bicuspid aortic valve. This test uses sound waves to create videos of the beating heart. It shows how blood moves through the heart chambers, the heart valves and the aorta.\n\n\nIf you have a bicuspid aortic valve, you'll usually have a CT scan to check for changes in the aorta's size.\n\n\nTreatment\nIf you have a bicuspid aortic valve, you are typically referred to a health care provider trained in congenital heart disease. This type of provider is called a congenital cardiologist.\n\n\nAnyone with a bicuspid aortic valve needs regular health checkups and imaging tests. Echocardiograms check for a narrowed or leaking aortic valve. The test also looks for changes in the size of the aorta.\n\n\nTreatment for a bicuspid aortic valve depends on the severity of heart valve disease. It may include medicines, procedures and surgery.\n\n\nMedications\nThere are no medicines to repair a bicuspid aortic valve. But medicines may be used to treat symptoms caused by heart valve disease. For example, your provider may recommend blood pressure medicine.\n\n\nSurgeries or other procedures\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t    Biological valve replacement\r\n\t    Enlarge image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\nBiological valve replacement\n\n\nBiological valve replacement\nIn a biological valve replacement, a valve made from cow, pig or human heart tissue replaces the damaged heart valve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t    Mechanical valve replacement\r\n\t    Enlarge image\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClose\n\n\n\nMechanical valve replacement\n\n\nMechanical valve replacement\nIn a mechanical valve replacement, an artificial heart valve made of strong material replaces the damaged valve.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurgery may be needed if a bicuspid aortic valve is causing:\n\n\n\nAortic valve stenosis.\nAortic valve regurgitation.\nAn enlarged aorta.\n\n\n\nSurgery is done to repair or replace the aortic valve. The type of surgery done depends on the specific heart valve condition and your symptoms.\n\n\n\n\nAortic valve replacement. The surgeon removes the damaged valve. It's replaced with a mechanical valve or a valve made from cow, pig or human heart tissue. The tissue valve is called a biological tissue valve. Sometimes, the aortic valve is replaced with the person's own lung valve. The lung valve is replaced with a lung tissue valve from a deceased donor. This more complicated surgery is called the Ross procedure.\nBiological tissue valves break down over time. They may eventually need to be replaced. If you have a mechanical valve, you need to take blood thinners for life to prevent blood clots. Together, you and your health care provider discuss the benefits and risks of each valve type.\n\nAortic root and ascending aorta surgery. Surgeons remove the enlarged section of the aorta located near the heart. It's replaced with a synthetic tube, called a graft, which is sewn into place. Sometimes, only the enlarged section of the aorta is removed and the aortic valve remains. The aortic valve also can be replaced or repaired during this procedure.\n\nBalloon valvuloplasty. This procedure can treat aortic valve stenosis in infants and children. In adults, the aortic valve tends to narrow again after the procedure. So it's usually only done if you're too ill for surgery or you're waiting for a valve replacement.\nThis heart valve procedure uses a thin, flexible tube called a catheter. The catheter has a balloon on the tip. The surgeon inserts the catheter into an artery in the arm or groin. Then the catheter is guided to the aortic valve. Once in place, the balloon inflates, making the valve opening bigger. The balloon is deflated. The catheter and balloon are removed.\n\n\n\n\nLifestyle and home remedies\nAnyone born with a bicuspid aortic valve needs health checkups for life. A provider trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist, should examine you for changes in your condition.\n\n\nPeople with a bicuspid aortic valve are more likely to develop an infection of the heart's lining. This infection is called infective endocarditis. Proper dental care can help lower your risk.\n\n\nA bicuspid aortic valve can be passed down in families, meaning it's inherited. Parents, children and siblings of someone with a bicuspid aortic valve should have an echocardiogram to check for the condition.\n\n\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff"

Symptoms may include:\n\n\n\nSwelling or a lump under your skin\nPain, tingling or numbness\nWeakness or loss of function in the affected area\nDizziness or loss of balance\n\n\n\nCauses\nThe cause of benign peripheral nerve tumors usually isn't known. Some are passed down in families.\n\n\nThe most common type of benign peripheral nerve tumor is a schwannoma. A schwannoma typically starts in a single bundle inside the main nerve, shifting the rest of the nerve.\n\n\nAnother common type is a neurofibroma. A neurofibroma also often forms inside the nerve. Sometimes it grows from several nerve bundles.\n\n\nPerineuriomas are rare and can grow from inside or outside the nerve. Tumors outside a nerve can cause problems when they press on the nerve. Other benign tumors that form outside nerves are soft lumps of slow-growing fat cells called lipomas and ganglion cysts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff"

  "symptoms": "Bee stings can produce different reactions, ranging from temporary pain and discomfort to a severe allergic reaction. Having one type of reaction doesn't mean you'll always have the same reaction every time you're stung or that the next reaction will necessarily be more severe.\n\n\nMild reaction\nMost of the time, bee sting symptoms are minor and include:\n\n\n\nInstant, sharp burning pain at the sting site\nA red welt at the sting area\nSlight swelling around the sting area\n\n\n\nIn most people, the swelling and pain go away within a few hours.\n\n\nModerate reaction\nSome people who get stung by a bee or other insect have a bit stronger reaction, with signs and symptoms such as:\n\n\n\nExtreme redness\nSwelling at the site of the sting that gradually enlarges over the next day or two\n\n\n\nModerate reactions tend to resolve over five to 10 days. Having a moderate reaction doesn't mean you'll have a severe allergic reaction the next time you're stung. But some people develop similar moderate reactions each time they're stung. If this happens to you, talk to your doctor about treatment and prevention, especially if the reaction becomes more severe each time.\n\n\nSevere allergic reaction\nA severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to bee stings is potentially life-threatening and requires emergency treatment. A small percentage of people who are stung by a bee or other insect quickly develop anaphylaxis. Signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis include:\n\n\n\nSkin reactions, including hives and itching and flushed or pale skin\nDifficulty breathing\nSwelling of the throat and tongue\nA weak, rapid pulse\nNausea, vomiting or diarrhea\nDizziness or fainting\nLoss of consciousness\n\n\n\nPeople who have a severe allergic reaction to a bee sting have a 25% to 65% chance of anaphylaxis the next time they're stung. Talk to your doctor or an allergy specialist about prevention measures such as immunotherapy (\"allergy shots\") to avoid a similar reaction in case you get stung again.\n\n\nMultiple bee stings\nGenerally, insects such as bees and wasps aren't aggressive and only sting in self-defense. In most cases, this results in one or perhaps a few stings. In some cases a person will disrupt a hive or swarm of bees and get multiple stings. Some types of bees \u2014 such as Africanized honeybees \u2014 are more likely than are other bees to swarm, stinging in a group.\n\n\nIf you get stung more than a dozen times, the accumulation of venom may induce a toxic reaction and make you feel quite sick. Signs and symptoms include:\n\n\n\nNausea, vomiting or diarrhea\nHeadache\nA feeling of spinning (vertigo)\nConvulsions\nFever\nDizziness or fainting\n\n\n\nMultiple stings can be a medical emergency in children, older adults, and people who have heart or breathing problems."

The rash is likely to be worse in areas where your swimsuit holds water against the skin.\n        Pseudofolliculitis barbae\n        Razor bumps affect people with curly beards. The condition is also called pseudofolliculitis barbae.

The superficial type involves part of the follicle, and the deep type involves the entire follicle and is usually more severe.Types of folliculitis, with the most common listed first, include:\nBacterial folliculitis. This common type is a rash of itchy, pus-filled bumps. It occurs when hair follicles become infected with bacteria, usually Staphylococcus aureus (staph). Staph bacteria live on the skin all the time. And they can cause problems when they enter the body through a cut or other wound.\nHot tub rash (pseudomonas folliculitis). This type is a rash of round, itchy bumps that can show up 1 to 2 days after exposure to the bacteria that causes it. Hot tub folliculitis is caused by pseudomonas bacteria, which can be found in hot tubs, water slides and heated pools in which the chlorine and pH levels aren't correct.\nRazor bumps (pseudofolliculitis barbae). This rash can look like folliculitis but it's caused by ingrown hairs, not infected follicles. It mainly affects people with curly hair who shave too close and is most noticeable on the face and neck. People who get bikini waxes may get razor bumps in the groin area.\nPityrosporum (pit-ih-ROS-puh-rum) folliculitis. This type is a rash of itchy, pus-filled bumps, most often on the back and chest. It's caused by a yeast infection.\nGram-negative folliculitis. This type causes pus-filled bumps around the nose and mouth. It sometimes develops in people who are receiving long-term antibiotic therapy for acne.\nEosinophilic (e-o-sin-o-FILL-ik) folliculitis. This type causes intense itching and recurring patches of bumps and pimples that form near hair follicles of the face and upper body. It mainly affects people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The cause of this condition isn't fully understood.\nBoils (furuncles) and carbuncles. These occur when hair follicles become deeply infected with staph bacteria. A boil tends to appear suddenly as a painful inflamed bump. A carbuncle is a cluster of boils.\nSycosis barbae. This type affects people who shave."

And there may be more tiredness, nausea and vomiting early in the pregnancy. Conjoined twins can be diagnosed early in the pregnancy using an ultrasound.\n\n\nHow twins are joined\nConjoined twins are usually classified according to where they're joined. The twins sometimes share organs or other parts of their bodies. Each pair of conjoined twins is unique.\n\n\nConjoined twins may be joined at any of these sites:\n\n\n\nChest. Thoracopagus (thor-uh-KOP-uh-gus) twins are joined face to face at the chest. They often have a shared heart and may also share one liver and upper intestine. This is one of the most common sites of conjoined twins.\nAbdomen. Omphalopagus (om-fuh-LOP-uh-gus) twins are joined near the bellybutton. Many omphalopagus twins share the liver and some part of the upper digestive (gastrointestinal or GI) tract. Some twins share the lower part of the small intestine (ileum) and the longest part of the large intestine (colon). They generally do not share a heart.\nBase of spine. Pygopagus (pie-GOP-uh-gus) twins are commonly joined back to back at the base of the spine and the buttocks. Some pygopagus twins share the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A few twins share the genital and urinary organs.\nLength of spine. Rachipagus (ray-KIP-uh-gus), also called rachiopagus (ray-kee-OP-uh-gus), twins are joined back to back along the length of the spine. This type is very rare.\nPelvis. Ischiopagus (is-kee-OP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the pelvis, either face to face or end to end. Many ischiopagus twins share the lower GI tract, as well as the liver and genital and urinary tract organs. Each twin may have two legs or, less commonly, the twins share two or three legs.\nTrunk. Parapagus (pa-RAP-uh-gus) twins are joined side to side at the pelvis and part or all of the belly (abdomen) and chest, but with separate heads. The twins can have two, three or four arms and two or three legs.\nHead. Craniopagus (kray-nee-OP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the back, top or side of the head, but not the face. Craniopagus twins share a portion of the skull. But their brains are usually separate, though they may share some brain tissue.\nHead and chest. Cephalopagus (sef-uh-LOP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the head and upper body. The faces are on opposite sides of a single shared head, and they share a brain. These twins rarely survive.\n\n\n\nIn rare cases, twins may be conjoined with one twin smaller and less fully formed than the other (asymmetric conjoined twins). In extremely rare cases, one twin may be found partially developed within the other twin (fetus in fetu)."

Blood often backs up and causes fluid to build up in the lungs and in the legs. The fluid buildup can cause shortness of breath and swelling of the legs and feet. Poor blood flow may cause the skin to appear blue or gray. Depending on your skin color, these color changes may be harder or easier to see. Some types of heart failure can lead to an enlarged heart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have heart failure, your heart can't supply enough blood to meet your body's needs.\n\n\nSymptoms may develop slowly. Sometimes, heart failure symptoms start suddenly. Heart failure symptoms may include:\n\n\n\nShortness of breath with activity or when lying down.\nFatigue and weakness.\nSwelling in the legs, ankles and feet.\nRapid or irregular heartbeat.\nReduced ability to exercise.\nWheezing.\nA cough that doesn't go away or a cough that brings up white or pink mucus with spots of blood.\nSwelling of the belly area.\nVery rapid weight gain from fluid buildup.\nNausea and lack of appetite.\nDifficulty concentrating or decreased alertness.\nChest pain if heart failure is caused by a heart attack."

  "title": "Craniosynostosis",
  "symptoms": "The signs of craniosynostosis are usually noticeable at birth, but they become more apparent during the first few months of your baby's life. Signs and severity depend on how many sutures are fused and when in brain development the fusion occurs. Signs and symptoms can include:\n\n\n\nA misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the sutures are affected\nDevelopment of a raised, hard ridge along affected sutures, with a change in the shape of the head that's not typical\n\n\n\nTypes of craniosynostosis\nThere are several types of craniosynostosis. Most involve the fusion of a single cranial suture. Some complex forms of craniosynostosis involve the fusion of multiple sutures. Multiple suture craniosynostosis is usually linked to genetic syndromes and is called syndromic craniosynostosis.\n\n\nThe term given to each type of craniosynostosis depends on what sutures are affected. Types of craniosynostosis include:\n\n\n\nSagittal (scaphocephaly). Premature fusion of the sagittal suture that runs from the front to the back at the top of the skull forces the head to grow long and narrow. This head shape is called scaphocephaly. Sagittal craniosynostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis.\nCoronal. Premature fusion of one of the coronal sutures (unicoronal) that run from each ear to the top of the skull may cause the forehead to flatten on the affected side and bulge on the unaffected side. It also leads to turning of the nose and a raised eye socket on the affected side. When both coronal sutures fuse prematurely (bicoronal), the head has a short and wide appearance, often with the forehead tilted forward.\nMetopic. The metopic suture runs from the top of the bridge of the nose up through the midline of the forehead to the anterior fontanel and the sagittal suture. Premature fusion gives the forehead a triangular appearance and widens the back part of the head. This head shape is also called trigonocephaly.\nLambdoid. Lambdoid synostosis is a rare type of craniosynostosis that involves the lambdoid suture, which runs along the back of the head. It may cause one side of a baby's head to appear flat, one ear to be higher than the other ear and tilting of the top of the head to one side.\n\n\n\nOther reasons for a misshapen head\nA misshapen head doesn't always indicate craniosynostosis. For example, if the back of your baby's head appears flattened, it could be the result of spending too much time lying on one side of the head. This can be treated with regular position changes, or if significant, with helmet therapy (cranial orthosis) to help reshape the head to a more balanced appearance."

Symptoms can last for days, weeks or even longer.\n\n\nCommon symptoms after a concussive traumatic brain injury are headache, loss of memory (amnesia) and confusion. The amnesia usually involves forgetting the event that caused the concussion.\n\n\nPhysical signs and symptoms of a concussion may include:\n\n\n\nHeadache\nRinging in the ears\nNausea\nVomiting\nFatigue or drowsiness\nBlurry vision\n\n\n\nOther signs and symptoms of a concussion include:\n\n\n\nConfusion or feeling as if in a fog\nAmnesia surrounding the traumatic event\nDizziness or \"seeing stars\"\n\n\n\nA witness may observe these signs and symptoms in the concussed person:\n\n\n\nTemporary loss of consciousness (though this doesn't always occur)\nSlurred speech\nDelayed response to questions\nDazed appearance\nForgetfulness, such as repeatedly asking the same question\n\n\n\nYou may have some symptoms of concussions immediately, and some can occur for days after the injury, such as:\n\n\n\nConcentration and memory complaints\nIrritability and other personality changes\nSensitivity to light and noise\nSleep disturbances\nPsychological adjustment problems and depression\nDisorders of taste and smell\n\n\n\nSymptoms in children\nHead trauma is very common in young children. But concussions can be difficult to recognize in infants and toddlers because they can't describe how they feel. Concussion clues may include:\n\n\n\nDazed appearance\nListlessness and tiring easily\nIrritability and crankiness\nLoss of balance and unsteady walking\nExcessive crying\nChange in eating or sleeping patterns\nLack of interest in favorite toys\nVomiting\nSeizures"

They steal simply because the urge is so powerful that they can't resist it.\nEpisodes of kleptomania generally happen suddenly, without planning and without help from another person.\nMost people with kleptomania steal from public places, such as stores. Some may steal from friends or acquaintances, such as at a party.\nOften, the stolen items have no value to the person with kleptomania, and the person can afford to buy them.\nThe stolen items are usually stashed away, never to be used. Items also may be donated, given away to family or friends, or even secretly returned to the place from which they were stolen.\nUrges to steal may come and go or may occur with greater or lesser intensity over the course of time."

  "symptoms": "Signs and symptoms of CAH vary, depending on which gene is affected and the level of enzyme deficiency. The imbalance of hormones the body needs to function may mean too little cortisol, too little aldosterone, excess androgens or a combination of these imbalances.\n\n\nClassic CAH\nSigns and symptoms of classic CAH may include:\n\n\n\nInsufficient cortisol. Classic CAH causes the body to produce an insufficient amount of cortisol. This can cause problems maintaining normal blood pressure, blood sugar and energy levels, and cause problems during physical stress such as illness.\nAdrenal crisis. People with classic CAH can be seriously affected by a lack of cortisol, aldosterone or both. This is known as an adrenal crisis, and it can be life-threatening.\n\nAtypical genitalia. Female infants may have atypical genitalia appearance, such as an enlarged clitoris that may resemble a penis, and a partially closed labia resembling a scrotum. The urinary opening (urethra) and the vagina may be only one opening instead of two separate openings. The uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries usually develop typically.\nMale infants usually have typical-appearing genitals.\n\n\nExcess androgen. An excess of the male sex hormone androgen can result in short height and early puberty for both males and females. Pubic hair and other signs of puberty may appear at a very early age. Severe acne also may occur.\nExcess androgen hormones in females may result in facial hair, excessive body hair and a deepening voice.\n\nAltered growth. Rapid growth may occur during childhood with an advanced bone age. Final height may be shorter than average.\nFertility issues. These can include irregular menstrual periods, or not having any at all, and having infertility problems in females. Fertility issues can sometimes occur in males.\n\n\n\nNonclassic CAH\nOften there are no symptoms of nonclassic CAH when a baby is born. Some people with nonclassic CAH never have symptoms. The condition is not identified on routine infant blood screening and usually becomes evident in late childhood or early adulthood. Cortisol may be the only hormone that's deficient.\n\n\nFemales who have nonclassic CAH may have typical-appearing genitals at birth. Later in life, they may experience:\n\n\n\nIrregular menstrual periods, or not having any at all, and problems getting pregnant\nMasculine characteristics such as facial hair, excessive body hair and a deepening voice\n\n\n\nIn both females and males, signs of nonclassic CAH may also include:\n\n\n\nEarly appearance of pubic hair and other signs of early puberty\nSevere acne\nRapid growth during childhood with an advanced bone age and shorter than expected final height"

  "title": "Hoarding disorder",
  "symptoms": "The first symptoms of hoarding disorder often appear during the teenage to early adult years. You may get and save too many items, gradually build up clutter in living spaces, and have difficulty getting rid of things.\n\n\nAs you grow older, you may continue getting and holding onto things that you may never use and don't have space for. By middle age, the clutter can become overwhelming as symptoms become more severe and increasingly difficult to treat.\n\n\nProblems with hoarding gradually develop over time and tend to be a private behavior. You may avoid having family, friends or repair workers in your home. Often, major clutter has developed by the time it reaches the attention of others.\n\n\nSymptoms of hoarding disorder may include:\n\n\n\nGetting and keeping too many items that you may not have a need for right now and don't have space for.\nOngoing difficulty throwing out or parting with your things, regardless of their actual value.\nFeeling a need to save these items and being upset by the thought of getting rid of them.\nBuilding up clutter to the point where you can't use rooms.\nTrying to be perfect and avoiding or delaying decisions.\nProblems with planning and organizing.\n\n\n\nGetting too many items and refusing to part with them results in:\n\n\n\nDisorganized piles or stacks of items, such as newspapers, clothes, paperwork, books or sentimental items.\nItems that crowd and clutter your walking spaces and living areas. Rooms can't be used for the intended purpose, such as not being able to sleep in your bed.\nBuildup of food or trash to large, unsanitary levels.\nDistress or problems functioning or keeping yourself, others and pets safe in your home.\nConflict with others who try to reduce or remove clutter from your home.\nRelationship issues, avoiding social activities and employment problems.\nDifficulty organizing items and sometimes losing important items in the clutter.\n\n\n\nWith hoarding disorder, items are usually saved because:\n\n\n\nYou believe these items are unique or that you'll need them at some point in the future.\nYou feel emotionally connected to items that remind you of happier times or represent beloved people or pets.\nYou feel safe and comforted when surrounded by things.\nYou don't want to waste anything.\n\n\n\nHoarding disorder is different from collecting. People who have collections, such as stamps or model cars, carefully search out specific items, organize them and display their collections. Collections can be large, but they aren't usually cluttered. Also, they don't cause the distress and problems functioning that are part of hoarding disorder.\n\n\nHoarding animals\nPeople who hoard animals may collect dozens or even hundreds of pets. Animals may be confined inside or outside. Because of the large numbers, these animals often aren't cared for properly. The health and safety of the person and the animals are often at risk because of unsanitary conditions."

  "title": "Depression (major depressive disorder)",
  "symptoms": "Although depression may occur only once during your life, people typically have multiple episodes. During these episodes, symptoms occur most of the day, nearly every day and may include:\n\n\n\nFeelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness\nAngry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters\nLoss of interest or pleasure in most or all normal activities, such as sex, hobbies or sports\nSleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much\nTiredness and lack of energy, so even small tasks take extra effort\nReduced appetite and weight loss or increased cravings for food and weight gain\nAnxiety, agitation or restlessness\nSlowed thinking, speaking or body movements\nFeelings of worthlessness or guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame\nTrouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things\nFrequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or suicide\nUnexplained physical problems, such as back pain or headaches\n\n\n\nFor many people with depression, symptoms usually are severe enough to cause noticeable problems in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships with others. Some people may feel generally miserable or unhappy without really knowing why.\n\n\nDepression symptoms in children and teens\nCommon signs and symptoms of depression in children and teenagers are similar to those of adults, but there can be some differences.\n\n\n\nIn younger children, symptoms of depression may include sadness, irritability, clinginess, worry, aches and pains, refusing to go to school, or being underweight.\nIn teens, symptoms may include sadness, irritability, feeling negative and worthless, anger, poor performance or poor attendance at school, feeling misunderstood and extremely sensitive, using recreational drugs or alcohol, eating or sleeping too much, self-harm, loss of interest in normal activities, and avoidance of social interaction.\n\n\n\nDepression symptoms in older adults\nDepression is not a normal part of growing older, and it should never be taken lightly. Unfortunately, depression often goes undiagnosed and untreated in older adults, and they may feel reluctant to seek help. Symptoms of depression may be different or less obvious in older adults, such as:\n\n\n\nMemory difficulties or personality changes\nPhysical aches or pain\nFatigue, loss of appetite, sleep problems or loss of interest in sex \u2014 not caused by a medical condition or medication\nOften wanting to stay at home, rather than going out to socialize or doing new things\nSuicidal thinking or feelings, especially in older men"

  "symptoms": "SymptomsValley fever is the initial form of coccidioidomycosis infection. This initial, acute illness can develop into a more serious disease, including chronic and disseminated coccidioidomycosis.Acute coccidioidomycosis (valley fever)The initial, or acute, form of coccidioidomycosis is often mild, with few or no symptoms. Signs and symptoms occur one to three weeks after exposure. They tend to be similar to flu symptoms. Symptoms can range from minor to severe, including:\nFever\nCough\nTiredness\nShortness of breath\nHeadache\nChills\nNight sweats\nJoint aches and muscle soreness\nRed, spotty rash, mainly on lower legs but sometimes on the chest, arms and back\nIf you don't become ill or have symptoms from valley fever, you may only find out you've been infected later. You may find out when you have a positive skin or blood test or when small areas of residual infection in the lungs (nodules) show up on a routine chest X-ray. The nodules typically don't cause problems, but they can look like cancer on X-rays.If you develop symptoms, especially severe ones, the course of the disease is highly variable. It can take months to fully recover. Fatigue and joint aches can last even longer. The disease's severity depends on several factors, including your overall health and the number of fungus spores you inhale.Chronic coccidioidomycosisIf the initial coccidioidomycosis infection doesn't completely resolve, it may progress to a chronic form of pneumonia. This complication is most common in people with weakened immune systems.Signs and symptoms include:\nLow-grade fever\nWeight loss\nCough\nChest pain\nBlood-tinged sputum (matter discharged during coughing)\nNodules in the lungs\nDisseminated coccidioidomycosisThe most serious form of the disease, disseminated coccidioidomycosis, is uncommon. It occurs when the infection spreads (disseminates) beyond the lungs to other parts of the body. Most often these parts include the skin, bones, liver, brain, heart, and the membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord (meninges).Signs and symptoms of disseminated disease depend on the body parts affected and may include:\nNodules, ulcers and skin lesions that are more serious than the rash that sometimes occurs with initial infection\nPainful lesions in the skull, spine or other bones\nPainful, swollen joints, especially in the knees or ankles\nMeningitis \u2014 an infection of the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord"

People with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease usually die of medical issues associated with the disease. They might include having trouble swallowing, falls, heart issues, lung failure, or pneumonia or other infections.In people with variant CJD, changes in mental abilities may be more apparent in the beginning of the disease. In many cases, dementia develops later in the illness. Symptoms of dementia include the loss of the ability to think, reason and remember.Variant CJD affects people at a younger age than CJD. Variant CJD appears to last 12 to 14 months.Another rare form of prion disease is called variably protease-sensitive prionopathy (VPSPr). It can mimic other forms of dementia. It causes changes in mental abilities and problems with speech and thinking. The course of the disease is longer than other prion diseases \u2014 about 24 months."

Others develop more-serious signs and symptoms of cholera, usually within a few days of infection.Symptoms of cholera infection can include:\nDiarrhea. Cholera-related diarrhea comes on suddenly and can quickly cause dangerous fluid loss \u2014 as much as a quart (about 1 liter) an hour. Diarrhea due to cholera often has a pale, milky appearance that resembles water in which rice has been rinsed.\nNausea and vomiting. Vomiting occurs especially in the early stages of cholera and can last for hours.\nDehydration. Dehydration can develop within hours after cholera symptoms start and range from mild to severe. A loss of 10% or more of body weight indicates severe dehydration.Signs and symptoms of cholera dehydration include irritability, fatigue, sunken eyes, a dry mouth, extreme thirst, dry and shriveled skin that's slow to bounce back when pinched into a fold, little or no urinating, low blood pressure, and an irregular heartbeat.\nDehydration can lead to a rapid loss of minerals in your blood that maintain the balance of fluids in your body. This is called an electrolyte imbalance.Electrolyte imbalanceAn electrolyte imbalance can lead to serious signs and symptoms such as:\nMuscle cramps. These result from the rapid loss of salts such as sodium, chloride and potassium.\nShock. This is one of the most serious complications of dehydration. It occurs when low blood volume causes a drop in blood pressure and a drop in the amount of oxygen in your body. If untreated, severe hypovolemic shock can cause death in minutes."

That makes them easy to overlook, which is why regular screening is important.\n\n\nSymptoms of Chlamydia trachomatis infection can include:\n\n\n\nPainful urination\nVaginal discharge\nDischarge from the penis\nPainful sexual intercourse in women\nVaginal bleeding between periods and after sex\nTesticular pain\n\n\n\nDepending on a person's sexual activity, Chlamydia trachomatis can infect the eyes, throat or rectum. Eye infections, called conjunctivitis, cause the inside of the eyelid to be red and irritated. In the throat, an infection may have no symptoms, or a person may have a sore throat. An infection in the rectum may have no symptoms or may cause rectal pain, discharge or bleeding."

And children normally carry different amounts of body fat at the various stages of development. So you might not know by how your child looks if weight is a health concern.\n\n\nThe body mass index (BMI), which provides a guideline of weight in relation to height, is the accepted measure of overweight and obesity. Your child's doctor can use growth charts, the BMI and, if necessary, other tests to help you figure out if your child's weight could pose health problems."

  "title": "Child abuse",
  "symptoms": "SymptomsA child who's being abused may feel guilty, ashamed or confused. The child may be afraid to tell anyone about the abuse, especially if the abuser is a parent, other relative or family friend. That's why it's vital to watch for red flags, such as:\nWithdrawal from friends or usual activities\nChanges in behavior \u2014 such as aggression, anger, hostility or hyperactivity \u2014 or changes in school performance\nDepression, anxiety or unusual fears, or a sudden loss of self-confidence\nSleep problems and nightmares \nAn apparent lack of supervision\nFrequent absences from school\nRebellious or defiant behavior\nSelf-harm or attempts at suicide\nSpecific signs and symptoms depend on the type of abuse and can vary. Keep in mind that warning signs are just that \u2014 warning signs. The presence of warning signs doesn't necessarily mean that a child is being abused.Physical abuse signs and symptoms\nUnexplained injuries, such as bruises, broken bones (fractures) or burns\nInjuries that don't match the given explanation\nInjuries that aren't compatible with the child's developmental ability\nSexual abuse signs and symptoms\nSexual behavior or knowledge that's inappropriate for the child's age\nPregnancy or a sexually transmitted infection\nGenital or anal pain, bleeding, or injury\nStatements by the child that he or she was sexually abused\nInappropriate sexual behavior with other children\nEmotional abuse signs and symptoms\nDelayed or inappropriate emotional development\nLoss of self-confidence or self-esteem\nSocial withdrawal or a loss of interest or enthusiasm\nDepression\nAvoidance of certain situations, such as refusing to go to school or ride the bus\nAppears to desperately seek affection\nA decrease in school performance or loss of interest in school\nLoss of previously acquired developmental skills\nNeglect signs and symptoms\nPoor growth\nExcessive weight with medical complications that are not being adequately addressed\nPoor personal cleanliness\nLack of clothing or supplies to meet physical needs\nHoarding or stealing food\nPoor record of school attendance\nLack of appropriate attention for medical, dental or psychological problems or lack of necessary follow-up care\nParental behaviorSometimes a parent's demeanor or behavior sends red flags about child abuse. Warning signs include a parent who:\nShows little concern for the child\nAppears unable to recognize physical or emotional distress in the child\nBlames the child for the problems\nConsistently belittles or berates the child, and describes the child with negative terms, such as \"worthless\" or \"evil\"\nExpects the child to provide attention and care to the parent and seems jealous of other family members getting attention from the child\nUses harsh physical discipline\nDemands an inappropriate level of physical or academic performance\nSeverely limits the child's contact with others\nOffers conflicting or unconvincing explanations for a child's injuries or no explanation at all\nRepeatedly brings the child for medical evaluations or requests medical tests, such as X-rays and lab tests, for concerns not seen during the health care provider's examination\nPhysical punishmentChild health experts condemn the use of violence in any form, but some people still use physical punishment, such as spanking, to discipline their children. While parents and caregivers often use physical punishment with the intention of helping their children or making their behavior better, research shows that spanking is linked with worse, not better, behavior. It's also linked to mental health problems, difficult relationships with parents, lower self-esteem and lower academic performance.Any physical punishment may leave emotional scars. Parental behaviors that cause pain, physical injury or emotional trauma \u2014 even when done in the name of discipline \u2014 could be child abuse."

So you may have bumps, blisters and scabs at the same time. You can spread the virus to other people for up to 48 hours before the rash appears. And the virus stays contagious until all broken blisters have crusted over.\n\n\n The disease is by and large mild in healthy children. But sometimes, the rash can cover the whole body.

  "title": "Drug addiction (substance use disorder)",
  "symptoms": "Drug addiction symptoms or behaviors include, among others:\n\n\n\nFeeling that you have to use the drug regularly \u2014 daily or even several times a day\nHaving intense urges for the drug that block out any other thoughts\nOver time, needing more of the drug to get the same effect\nTaking larger amounts of the drug over a longer period of time than you intended\nMaking certain that you maintain a supply of the drug\nSpending money on the drug, even though you can't afford it\nNot meeting obligations and work responsibilities, or cutting back on social or recreational activities because of drug use\nContinuing to use the drug, even though you know it's causing problems in your life or causing you physical or psychological harm\nDoing things to get the drug that you normally wouldn't do, such as stealing\nDriving or doing other risky activities when you're under the influence of the drug\nSpending a good deal of time getting the drug, using the drug or recovering from the effects of the drug\nFailing in your attempts to stop using the drug\nExperiencing withdrawal symptoms when you attempt to stop taking the drug\n\n\n\nRecognizing unhealthy drug use in family members\nSometimes it's difficult to distinguish normal teenage moodiness or anxiety from signs of drug use. Possible signs that your teenager or other family member is using drugs include:\n\n\n\nProblems at school or work \u2014 frequently missing school or work, a sudden disinterest in school activities or work, or a drop in grades or work performance\nPhysical health issues \u2014 lack of energy and motivation, weight loss or gain, or red eyes\nNeglected appearance \u2014 lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks\nChanges in behavior \u2014 major efforts to bar family members from entering the teenager's room or being secretive about going out with friends; or drastic changes in behavior and in relationships with family and friends\nMoney issues \u2014 sudden requests for money without a reasonable explanation; or your discovery that money is missing or has been stolen or that items have disappeared from your home, indicating maybe they're being sold to support drug use\n\n\n\nRecognizing signs of drug use or intoxication\nSigns and symptoms of drug use or intoxication may vary, depending on the type of drug. Below you'll find several examples.\n\n\nMarijuana, hashish and other cannabis-containing substances\nPeople use cannabis by smoking, eating or inhaling a vaporized form of the drug. Cannabis often precedes or is used along with other substances, such as alcohol or illegal drugs, and is often the first drug tried.\n\n\nSigns and symptoms of recent use can include:\n\n\n\nA sense of euphoria or feeling \"high\"\nA heightened sense of visual, auditory and taste perception\nIncreased blood pressure and heart rate\nRed eyes\nDry mouth\nDecreased coordination\nDifficulty concentrating or remembering\nSlowed reaction time\nAnxiety or paranoid thinking\nCannabis odor on clothes or yellow fingertips\nMajor cravings for certain foods at unusual times\n\n\n\nLong-term use is often associated with:\n\n\n\nDecreased mental sharpness\nPoor performance at school or at work\nOngoing cough and frequent lung infections\n\n\n\nK2, Spice and bath salts\nTwo groups of synthetic drugs \u2014 synthetic cannabinoids and substituted or synthetic cathinones \u2014 are illegal in most states. The effects of these drugs can be dangerous and unpredictable, as there is no quality control and some ingredients may not be known.\n\n\nSynthetic cannabinoids, also called K2 or Spice, are sprayed on dried herbs and then smoked, but can be prepared as an herbal tea. A liquid form can be vaporized in electronic cigarettes. Despite manufacturer claims, these are chemical compounds rather than \"natural\" or harmless products. These drugs can produce a \"high\" similar to marijuana and have become a popular but dangerous alternative.\n\n\nSigns and symptoms of recent use can include:\n\n\n\nA sense of euphoria or feeling \"high\"\nElevated mood\nAn altered sense of visual, auditory and taste perception\nExtreme anxiety or agitation\nParanoia\nHallucinations\nIncreased heart rate and blood pressure or heart attack\nVomiting\nConfusion\nViolent behavior\n\n\n\nSubstituted cathinones, also called \"bath salts,\" are mind-altering (psychoactive) substances similar to amphetamines such as ecstasy (MDMA) and cocaine. Packages are often labeled as other products to avoid detection.\n\n\nDespite the name, these are not bath products such as Epsom salts. Substituted cathinones can be eaten, snorted, inhaled or injected and are highly addictive. These drugs can cause severe intoxication, which results in dangerous health effects or even death.\n\n\nSigns and symptoms of recent use can include:\n\n\n\nFeeling \"high\"\nIncreased sociability\nIncreased energy and agitation\nIncreased sex drive\nIncreased heart rate and blood pressure\nProblems thinking clearly\nLoss of muscle control\nParanoia\nPanic attacks\nHallucinations\nDelirium\nPsychotic and violent behavior\n\n\n\nBarbiturates, benzodiazepines and hypnotics\nBarbiturates, benzodiazepines and hypnotics are prescription central nervous system depressants. They're often used and misused in search for a sense of relaxation or a desire to \"switch off\" or forget stress-related thoughts or feelings.\n\n\n\nBarbiturates. An example is phenobarbital.\nBenzodiazepines. Examples include sedatives, such as diazepam (Valium), alprazolam (Xanax), lorazepam (Ativan), clonazepam (Klonopin) and chlordiazepoxide (Librium).\nHypnotics. Examples include prescription sleeping medicines such as zolpidem (Ambien) and zaleplon (Sonata).\n\n\n\nSigns and symptoms of recent use can include:\n\n\n\nDrowsiness\nSlurred speech\nLack of coordination\nIrritability or changes in mood\nProblems concentrating or thinking clearly\nMemory problems\nInvoluntary eye movements\nLack of inhibition\nSlowed breathing and reduced blood pressure\nFalls or accidents\nDizziness\n\n\n\nMeth, cocaine and other stimulants\nStimulants include amphetamines, meth (methamphetamine), cocaine, methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, others) and amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (Adderall XR, Mydayis). They're often used and misused in search of a \"high,\" or to boost energy, to improve performance at work or school, or to lose weight or control appetite.\n\n\nSigns and symptoms of recent use can include:\n\n\n\nFeeling of happy excitement and too much confidence\nIncreased alertness\nIncreased energy and restlessness\nBehavior changes or aggression\nRapid or rambling speech\nLarger than usual pupils, the black circles in the middle of the eyes\nConfusion, delusions and hallucinations\nIrritability, anxiety or paranoia\nChanges in heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature\nNausea or vomiting with weight loss\nPoor judgment\nNasal congestion and damage to the mucous membrane of the nose (if snorting drugs)\nMouth sores, gum disease and tooth decay from smoking drugs (\"meth mouth\")\nInsomnia\nDepression as the drug wears off\n\n\n\nClub drugs\nClub drugs are commonly used at clubs, concerts and parties. Examples include methylenedioxymethamphetamine, also called MDMA, ecstasy or molly, and gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, known as GHB. Other examples include ketamine and flunitrazepam or Rohypnol \u2014 a brand used outside the U.S. \u2014 also called roofie. These drugs are not all in the same category, but they share some similar effects and dangers, including long-term harmful effects.\n\n\nBecause GHB and flunitrazepam can cause sedation, muscle relaxation, confusion and memory loss, the potential for sexual misconduct or sexual assault is associated with the use of these drugs.\n\n\nSigns and symptoms of use of club drugs can include:\n\n\n\nHallucinations\nParanoia\nLarger than usual pupils\nChills and sweating\nInvoluntary shaking (tremors)\nBehavior changes\nMuscle cramping and teeth clenching\nMuscle relaxation, poor coordination or problems moving\nReduced inhibitions\nHeightened or altered sense of sight, sound and taste\nPoor judgment\nMemory problems or loss of memory\nReduced consciousness\nIncreased or decreased heart rate and blood pressure\n\n\n\nHallucinogens\nUse of hallucinogens can produce different signs and symptoms, depending on the drug. The most common hallucinogens are lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and phencyclidine (PCP).\n\n\nLSD use may cause:\n\n\n\nHallucinations\nGreatly reduced perception of reality, for example, interpreting input from one of your senses as another, such as hearing colors\nImpulsive behavior\nRapid shifts in emotions\nPermanent mental changes in perception\nRapid heart rate and high blood pressure\nTremors\nFlashbacks, a reexperience of the hallucinations \u2014 even years later\n\n\n\nPCP use may cause:\n\n\n\nA feeling of being separated from your body and surroundings\nHallucinations\nProblems with coordination and movement\nAggressive, possibly violent behavior\nInvoluntary eye movements\nLack of pain sensation\nIncrease in blood pressure and heart rate\nProblems with thinking and memory\nProblems speaking\nPoor judgment\nIntolerance to loud noise\nSometimes seizures or coma\n\n\n\nInhalants\nSigns and symptoms of inhalant use vary, depending on the substance. Some commonly inhaled substances include glue, paint thinners, correction fluid, felt tip marker fluid, gasoline, cleaning fluids and household aerosol products. Due to the toxic nature of these substances, users may develop brain damage or sudden death.\n\n\nSigns and symptoms of use can include:\n\n\n\nPossessing an inhalant substance without a reasonable explanation\nBrief happy excitement\nBehaving as if drunk\nReduced ability to keep impulses under control\nAggressive behavior or eagerness to fight\nDizziness\nNausea or vomiting\nInvoluntary eye movements\nAppearing under the influence of drugs, with slurred speech, slow movements and poor coordination\nIrregular heartbeats\nTremors\nLingering odor of inhalant material\nRash around the nose and mouth\n\n\n\nOpioid painkillers\nOpioids are narcotic, painkilling drugs produced from opium or made synthetically. This class of drugs includes, among others, heroin, morphine, codeine, methadone, fentanyl and oxycodone.\n\n\nSometimes called the \"opioid epidemic,\" addiction to opioid prescription pain medicines has reached an alarming rate across the United States. Some people who've been using opioids over a long period of time may need physician-prescribed temporary or long-term drug substitution during treatment.\n\n\nSigns and symptoms of narcotic use and dependence can include:\n\n\n\nA sense of feeling \"high\"\nReduced sense of pain\nAgitation, drowsiness or sedation\nSlurred speech\nProblems with attention and memory\nPupils that are smaller than usual\nLack of awareness or inattention to surrounding people and things\nProblems with coordination\nDepression\nConfusion\nConstipation\nRunny nose or nose sores (if snorting drugs)\nNeedle marks (if injecting drugs)"

  "title": "Childhood apraxia of speech",
  "symptoms": "Children with childhood apraxia of speech (CAS) may have a variety of speech symptoms. Symptoms vary depending on a child's age and the severity of the speech problems.\n\n\nCAS can result in:\n\n\n\nBabbling less or making fewer vocal sounds than is typical between the ages of 7 to 12 months.\nSpeaking first words late, typically after ages 12 to 18 months old.\nUsing a limited number of consonants and vowels.\nOften leaving out sounds when speaking.\nUsing speech that is hard to understand.\n\n\n\nThese symptoms are usually noticed between ages 18 months and 2 years. Symptoms at this age may indicate suspected CAS. Suspected CAS means a child may potentially have this speech disorder. The child's speech development should be watched to determine if therapy should begin.\n\n\nChildren usually produce more speech between ages 2 and 4. Signs that may indicate CAS include:\n\n\n\nVowel and consonant distortions.\nPauses between syllables or words.\nVoicing errors, such as \"pie\" sounding like \"bye.\"\n\n\n\nMany children with CAS have trouble getting their jaws, lips and tongues to the correct positions to make a sound. They also may have a hard time moving smoothly to the next sound.\n\n\nMany children with CAS also have language problems, such as reduced vocabulary or trouble with word order.\n\n\nSome symptoms may be unique to children with CAS, which helps to make a diagnosis. However, some symptoms of CAS are also symptoms of other types of speech or language disorders. It's hard to diagnose CAS if a child has only symptoms that are found both in CAS and in other disorders.\n\n\nSome characteristics, sometimes called markers, help distinguish CAS from other types of speech disorders. Those associated with CAS include:\n\n\n\nTrouble moving smoothly from one sound, syllable or word to another.\nGroping movements with the jaw, lips or tongue to try to make the correct movement for speech sounds.\nVowel distortions, such as trying to use the correct vowel but saying it incorrectly.\nUsing the wrong stress in a word, such as pronouncing \"banana\" as \"BUH-nan-uh\" instead of \"buh-NAN-uh.\"\nUsing equal emphasis on all syllables, such as saying \"BUH-NAN-UH.\"\nSeparation of syllables, such as putting a pause or gap between syllables.\nInconsistency, such as making different errors when trying to say the same word a second time.\nHaving a hard time imitating simple words.\nVoicing errors, such as saying \"down\" instead of \"town.\"\n\n\n\nOther speech disorders sometimes confused with CAS\nSome speech sound disorders often get confused with CAS because some of the symptoms may overlap. These speech sound disorders include articulation disorders, phonological disorders and dysarthria.\n\n\nA child with an articulation or phonological disorder has trouble learning how to make and use specific sounds. Unlike in CAS, the child doesn't have trouble planning or coordinating the movements to speak. Articulation and phonological disorders are more common than CAS.\n\n\nArticulation or phonological speech errors may include:\n\n\n\nSubstituting sounds. The child might say \"fum\" instead of \"thumb,\" \"wabbit\" instead of \"rabbit\" or \"tup\" instead of \"cup.\"\nLeaving out final consonants. A child with CAS might say \"duh\" instead of \"duck\" or \"uh\" instead of \"up.\"\nStopping the airstream. The child might say \"tun\" instead of \"sun\" or \"doo\" instead of \"zoo.\"\nSimplifying sound combinations. The child might say \"ting\" instead of \"string\" or \"fog\" instead of \"frog.\"\n\n\n\nDysarthria is a speech disorder that occurs because the speech muscles are weak. Making speech sounds is hard because the speech muscles can't move as far, as quickly or as strongly as they do during typical speech. People with dysarthria may also have a hoarse, soft or even strained voice. Or they may have slurred or slow speech.\n\n\nDysarthria is often easier to identify than CAS. However, when dysarthria is caused by damage to areas of the brain that affect coordination, it can be hard to determine the differences between CAS and dysarthria."

Atherosclerosis reduces blood flow to the heart and other parts of the body.

Women are more likely to have other symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue.\n\n\nSymptoms of coronary artery disease can include:\n\n\n\nChest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)\nShortness of breath\nPain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper belly area or back\nPain, numbness, weakness or coldness in the legs or arms if the blood vessels in those body areas are narrowed\n\n\n\nYou might not be diagnosed with coronary artery disease until you have a heart attack, angina, stroke or heart failure. It's important to watch for heart symptoms and discuss concerns with your health care provider. Heart (cardiovascular) disease can sometimes be found early with regular health checkups.\n\n\n\nWhat is coronary artery disease? A Mayo Clinic cardiologist explains.\nStephen Kopecky, M.D., talks about the risk factors, symptoms and treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). Learn how lifestyle changes can lower your risk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow transcript for video What is coronary artery disease? A Mayo Clinic cardiologist explains.\n\n{Music playing}\nStephen Kopecky, M.D., Cardiovascular Disease, Mayo Clinic: I'm Dr. Stephen Kopecky, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic. In this video, we'll cover the basics of coronary artery disease. What is it? Who gets it? The symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. Whether you're looking for answers for yourself or someone you love, we're here to give you the best information available.\nCoronary artery disease, also called CAD, is a condition that affects your heart. It is the most common heart disease in the United States. CAD happens when coronary arteries struggle to supply the heart with enough blood, oxygen and nutrients. Cholesterol deposits, or plaques, are almost always to blame. These buildups narrow your arteries, decreasing blood flow to your heart. This can cause chest pain, shortness of breath or even a heart attack. CAD typically takes a long time to develop. So often, patients don't know that they have it until there's a problem. But there are ways to prevent coronary artery disease, and ways to know if you're at risk and ways to treat it.\nWho gets it?\nAnyone can develop CAD. It begins when fats, cholesterols and other substances gather along the walls of your arteries. This process is called atherosclerosis. It's typically no cause for concern. However, too much buildup can lead to a blockage, obstructing blood flow. There are a number of risk factors, common red flags, that can contribute to this and ultimately lead to coronary artery disease. First, getting older can mean more damaged and narrowed arteries. Second, men are generally at a greater risk. But the risk for women increases after menopause. Existing health conditions matter, too. High blood pressure can thicken your arteries, narrowing your blood flow. High cholesterol levels can increase the rate of plaque buildup. Diabetes is also associated with higher risk, as is being overweight. Your lifestyle plays a large role as well. Physical inactivity, long periods of unrelieved stress in your life, an unhealthy diet and smoking can all increase your risk. And finally, family history. If a close relative was diagnosed at an early age with heart disease, you're at a greater risk. All these factors together can paint a picture of your risk for developing CAD.\nWhat are the symptoms?\nWhen coronary arteries become narrow, the heart doesn't get enough oxygen-rich blood. Remember, unlike most pumps, the heart has to pump its own energy supply. It's working harder with less. And you may begin to notice these signs and symptoms of pressure or tightness in your chest. This pain is called angina. It may feel like somebody is standing on your chest. When your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs, you might develop shortness of breath or extreme fatigue during activities. And if an artery becomes totally blocked, it leads to a heart attack. Classic signs and symptoms of a heart attack include crushing, substernal chest pain, pain in your shoulders or arms, shortness of breath, and sweating. However, many heart attacks have minimal or no symptoms and are found later during routine testing.\nHow is it diagnosed?\nDiagnosing CAD starts by talking to your doctor. They'll be able to look at your medical history, do a physical exam and order routine blood work. Depending on that, they may suggest one or more of the following tests: an electrocardiogram or ECG, an echocardiogram or soundwave test of the heart, stress test, cardiac catheterization and angiogram, or a cardiac CT scan.\nHow is it treated?\nTreating coronary artery disease usually means making changes to your lifestyle. This might be eating healthier foods, exercising regularly, losing excess weight, reducing stress or quitting smoking. The good news is these changes can do a lot to improve your outlook. Living a healthier life translates to having healthier arteries. When necessary, treatment could involve drugs like aspirin, cholesterol-modifying medications, beta-blockers, or certain medical procedures like angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery.\nWhat now?\nDiscovering you have coronary artery disease can be overwhelming. But be encouraged. There are things you can do to manage and live with this condition. Reducing cholesterol, lowering blood pressure, quitting tobacco, eating healthier, exercising and managing your stress can make a world of difference. Better heart health starts by educating yourself. So don't be afraid to seek out information and ask your doctors about coronary artery disease.

We wish you well.\n\n\n\n\nHeart disease symptoms caused by irregular heartbeats (heart arrhythmias)\nThe heart may beat too quickly, too slowly or irregularly. Heart arrhythmia symptoms can include:\n\n\n\nChest pain or discomfort\nDizziness\nFainting (syncope) or near fainting\nFluttering in the chest\nLightheadedness\nRacing heartbeat (tachycardia)\nShortness of breath\nSlow heartbeat (bradycardia)\n\n\n\nHeart disease symptoms caused by congenital heart defects\nSerious congenital heart defects usually are noticed soon after birth. Congenital heart defect symptoms in children could include:\n\n\n\nPale gray or blue skin or lips (cyanosis)\nSwelling in the legs, belly area or areas around the eyes\nIn an infant, shortness of breath during feedings, leading to poor weight gain\n\n\n\nLess-serious congenital heart defects are often not diagnosed until later in childhood or during adulthood. Symptoms of congenital heart defects that usually aren't immediately life-threatening include:\n\n\n\nEasily getting short of breath during exercise or activity\nEasily tiring during exercise or activity\nSwelling of the hands, ankles or feet\n\n\n\nHeart disease symptoms caused by diseased heart muscle (cardiomyopathy)\nEarly stages of cardiomyopathy may not cause noticeable symptoms. As the condition worsens, symptoms may include:\n\n\n\nDizziness, lightheadedness and fainting\nFatigue\nFeeling short of breath during activity or at rest\nFeeling short of breath at night when trying to sleep or waking up short of breath\nIrregular heartbeats that feel rapid, pounding or fluttering\nSwollen legs, ankles or feet\n\n\n\nHeart disease symptoms caused by heart valve problems (valvular heart disease)\nThe heart has four valves \u2014 the aortic, mitral, pulmonary and tricuspid valves. They open and close to move blood through the heart. Many things can damage the heart valves. A heart valve may become narrowed (stenosis), leaky (regurgitation or insufficiency) or close improperly (prolapse).\n\n\nValvular heart disease is also called heart valve disease. Depending on which valve isn't working properly, heart valve disease symptoms generally include:\n\n\n\nChest pain\nFainting (syncope)\nFatigue\nIrregular heartbeat\nShortness of breath\nSwollen feet or ankles\n\n\n\nEndocarditis is an infection that affects the heart valves and inner lining of the heart chambers and heart valves (endocardium). Endocarditis symptoms can include:\n\n\n\nDry or persistent cough\nFever\nHeartbeat changes\nShortness of breath\nSkin rashes or unusual spots\nSwelling of the legs or belly area\nWeakness or fatigue"

Signs and symptoms of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system often begin even before a cancer is diagnosed.\n\n\nSigns and symptoms vary depending on the body part being injured, and may include:\n\n\n\nDifficulty walking\nDifficulty maintaining balance\nLoss of muscle coordination\nLoss of muscle tone or weakness\nLoss of fine motor skills, such as picking up objects\nDifficulty swallowing\nSlurred speech or stuttering\nMemory loss and other thinking (cognitive) impairment\nVision problems\nSleep disturbances\nSeizures\nHallucinations\nUnusual involuntary movements\n\n\n\nTypes of paraneoplastic syndromes\nExamples of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system include:\n\n\n\nCerebellar degeneration (cerebellar ataxia). This is the loss of nerve cells in the area of the brain that controls muscle functions and balance (cerebellum). Signs and symptoms may include unsteady or impaired walking, lack of muscle coordination in your limbs, inability to maintain your trunk posture, dizziness, nausea, involuntary eye movement, double vision, difficulty speaking, or difficulty swallowing.\nLimbic encephalitis. This is inflammation affecting a region of the brain known as the limbic system, which controls emotions, behaviors and certain memory functions. People with this disorder may experience personality changes or mood disturbances, memory loss, seizures, hallucinations, or drowsiness.\nEncephalomyelitis. This syndrome refers to inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. There may be a wide variety of symptoms and signs depending on the area affected.\nOpsoclonus-myoclonus. This syndrome is due to dysfunction of the cerebellum or its connections. It can cause rapid, irregular eye movements (opsoclonus) and involuntary, chaotic muscle jerks (myoclonus) in your limbs and trunk.\nStiff person syndrome. Previously called stiff man syndrome, this syndrome is characterized by progressive, severe muscle stiffness or rigidity, mainly affecting your spine and legs. It may also cause painful muscle spasms.\nMyelopathy. This term refers to a syndrome of injury limited to the spinal cord. Depending on the level of spinal cord injury, you may have changes in bowel and bladder function, and severe weakness and numbness up to a certain level in your body. If the level of injury includes your neck, you can have severe disability affecting all four limbs.\n\nLambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. This is a syndrome caused by disrupted communication between nerves and muscles. Signs and symptoms include pelvic and lower extremity muscle weakness, fatigue, difficulty swallowing, difficulty speaking, irregular eye movement, and double vision. Autonomic nervous system problems can include dry mouth and erectile dysfunction in males.\nWhen it occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome is typically associated with lung cancer.\n\n\nMyasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is also related to disrupted communication between nerves and muscles and also characterized by weakness and rapid fatigue of any of the muscles that are under voluntary control, including muscles in your face, eyes, arms and legs. The muscles involved in chewing, swallowing, talking and breathing may be affected as well.\nWhen myasthenia gravis occurs as a paraneoplastic syndrome, it is typically associated with cancer of the thymus gland (thymoma).\n\nNeuromyotonia. Neuromyotonia \u2014 also known as Isaacs' syndrome \u2014 is characterized by abnormal impulses in nerve cells outside the brain and spinal cord (peripheral nerve hyperexcitability) that control muscle movement. These impulses can cause twitching, muscle rippling that looks like a \"bag of worms,\" progressive stiffness, muscle cramps, slowed movement and other muscle impairments.\nPeripheral neuropathy. This condition refers to patterns of damage to nerves that transmit messages from the brain or spinal column to the rest of your body. When damage involves only the sensory nerves of the peripheral nervous system, you can have pain and disturbances in sensation anywhere in your body.\nDysautonomia. Dysautonomia refers to a wide range of signs and symptoms resulting from injury to the nerves that regulate involuntary body functions (autonomic nervous system), such as heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and bowel and bladder functions. When this part of the nervous system is affected, common symptoms are low blood pressure, irregular heartbeats and trouble breathing."

Blood-clotting factors are substances in your blood that help stop bleeding. These abnormalities can lead to small blood clots forming more often than they normally would.\n\n\nIn addition, people with calciphylaxis have an imbalance in the metabolism of calcium. This causes calcium to be deposited in the smallest parts of the arteries (arterioles), which eventually leads to the formation of blood clots in the arterioles. Blood clots can cause fat tissues and skin to be deprived of oxygen and nourishment."

  "title": "Priapism",
  "symptoms": "SymptomsPriapism symptoms vary depending on the type of priapism. The two main types of priapism are ischemic priapism and nonischemic priapism.Ischemic priapismIschemic priapism, also called low-flow priapism, is the result of blood not being able to leave the penis. Blood is trapped in the penis because it cannot flow out of the veins of the penis or there is a problem with the contraction of smooth muscles within the erectile tissue of the penis. Ischemic priapism is the more common type of priapism and requires immediate medical care to prevent complications caused by not getting enough oxygen to the penile tissue.Signs and symptoms include:\nErection lasting more than four hours or unrelated to sexual interest or stimulation\nRigid penile shaft, but the tip of penis (glans) is soft\nProgressively worsening penile pain\nStuttering priapism \u2014 also called recurrent or intermittent priapism \u2014 is a form of ischemic priapism. An uncommon condition, stuttering priapism describes repetitive episodes of prolonged erections and often includes episodes of ischemic priapism. It occurs more often in males who have an inherited disorder characterized by abnormally shaped red blood cells (sickle cell disease). Sickle cells can block the blood vessels in the penis. In some cases, the condition starts off with unwanted and painful erections of short duration and might progress over time to more-frequent and more-prolonged erections. Stuttering priapism may begin in childhood.Nonischemic priapismNonischemic priapism, also known as high-flow priapism, occurs when blood flow through the arteries of the penis isn't working properly. However, the penile tissues continue to receive some blood flow and oxygen. Nonischemic priapism often occurs due to trauma.Signs and symptoms include:\nErection lasting more than four hours or unrelated to sexual interest or stimulation\nErect but not fully rigid penile shaft\nUsually not painful"

Even though the digestive tract looks normal, it doesn't function as it should. Muscles in the intestines move food from the stomach to the rectum. Normally, they contract and relax in a gentle rhythm that moves the food along in a fairly predictable schedule. But with some people, the muscles in the intestines spasm. That means the contractions are longer and stronger than normal. Those spasms are painful. They also disrupt the movement of food through the intestines. If they slow it down, you become constipated. If they cause it to move through too quickly, you get diarrhea. It's not unusual for people to alternate between the two. Another cause of discomfort for people with IBS results from oversensitive nerve endings in the digestive tract. Small bubbles of gas that wouldn't bother most people might be quite painful for you. Your heightened sensitivity can also lead to swelling and bloating."

Other children may develop normally for the first few months or years of life, but then suddenly become withdrawn or aggressive or lose language skills they've already acquired. Signs usually are seen by age 2 years.\n\n\nEach child with autism spectrum disorder is likely to have a unique pattern of behavior and level of severity \u2014 from low functioning to high functioning.\n\n\nSome children with autism spectrum disorder have difficulty learning, and some have signs of lower than normal intelligence. Other children with the disorder have normal to high intelligence \u2014 they learn quickly, yet have trouble communicating and applying what they know in everyday life and adjusting to social situations.\n\n\nBecause of the unique mixture of symptoms in each child, severity can sometimes be difficult to determine. It's generally based on the level of impairments and how they impact the ability to function.\n\n\nBelow are some common signs shown by people who have autism spectrum disorder.\n\n\nSocial communication and interaction\nA child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have problems with social interaction and communication skills, including any of these signs:\n\n\n\nFails to respond to his or her name or appears not to hear you at times\nResists cuddling and holding, and seems to prefer playing alone, retreating into his or her own world\nHas poor eye contact and lacks facial expression\nDoesn't speak or has delayed speech, or loses previous ability to say words or sentences\nCan't start a conversation or keep one going, or only starts one to make requests or label items\nSpeaks with an abnormal tone or rhythm and may use a singsong voice or robot-like speech\nRepeats words or phrases verbatim, but doesn't understand how to use them\nDoesn't appear to understand simple questions or directions\nDoesn't express emotions or feelings and appears unaware of others' feelings\nDoesn't point at or bring objects to share interest\nInappropriately approaches a social interaction by being passive, aggressive or disruptive\nHas difficulty recognizing nonverbal cues, such as interpreting other people's facial expressions, body postures or tone of voice\n\n\n\nPatterns of behavior\nA child or adult with autism spectrum disorder may have limited, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests or activities, including any of these signs:\n\n\n\nPerforms repetitive movements, such as rocking, spinning or hand flapping\nPerforms activities that could cause self-harm, such as biting or head-banging\nDevelops specific routines or rituals and becomes disturbed at the slightest change\nHas problems with coordination or has odd movement patterns, such as clumsiness or walking on toes, and has odd, stiff or exaggerated body language\nIs fascinated by details of an object, such as the spinning wheels of a toy car, but doesn't understand the overall purpose or function of the object\nIs unusually sensitive to light, sound or touch, yet may be indifferent to pain or temperature\nDoesn't engage in imitative or make-believe play\nFixates on an object or activity with abnormal intensity or focus\nHas specific food preferences, such as eating only a few foods, or refusing foods with a certain texture\n\n\n\nAs they mature, some children with autism spectrum disorder become more engaged with others and show fewer disturbances in behavior. Some, usually those with the least severe problems, eventually may lead normal or near-normal lives. Others, however, continue to have difficulty with language or social skills, and the teen years can bring worse behavioral and emotional problems."

For example:\n\n\n\nIf you have atherosclerosis in your heart arteries, you may have chest pain or pressure (angina).\nIf you have atherosclerosis in the arteries leading to your brain, you may have sudden numbness or weakness in your arms or legs, difficulty speaking or slurred speech, temporary loss of vision in one eye, or drooping muscles in your face. These signal a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Untreated, a TIA can lead to a stroke.\nIf you have atherosclerosis in the arteries in your arms and legs, you may have symptoms of peripheral artery disease, such as leg pain when walking (claudication) or decreased blood pressure in an affected limb.\nIf you have atherosclerosis in the arteries leading to your kidneys, you may develop high blood pressure or kidney failure."

These panic attacks may lead to worrying about them happening again or avoiding situations in which they've occurred.\nSelective mutism is a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. This can interfere with school, work and social functioning.\nSeparation anxiety disorder is a childhood disorder characterized by anxiety that's excessive for the child's developmental level and related to separation from parents or others who have parental roles.\nSocial anxiety disorder (social phobia) involves high levels of anxiety, fear and avoidance of social situations due to feelings of embarrassment, self-consciousness and concern about being judged or viewed negatively by others.\nSpecific phobias are characterized by major anxiety when you're exposed to a specific object or situation and a desire to avoid it. Phobias provoke panic attacks in some people.\nSubstance-induced anxiety disorder is characterized by symptoms of intense anxiety or panic that are a direct result of misusing drugs, taking medications, being exposed to a toxic substance or withdrawal from drugs. \nOther specified anxiety disorder and unspecified anxiety disorder are terms for anxiety or phobias that don't meet the exact criteria for any other anxiety disorders but are significant enough to be distressing and disruptive."

  "title": "Sickle cell anemia",
  "symptoms": "SymptomsSigns and symptoms of sickle cell anemia usually appear around 6 months of age. They vary from person to person and may change over time. Signs and symptoms can include:\nAnemia. Sickle cells break apart easily and die. Red blood cells usually live for about 120 days before they need to be replaced. But sickle cells typically die in 10 to 20 days, leaving a shortage of red blood cells (anemia). Without enough red blood cells, the body can't get enough oxygen and this causes fatigue.\n Episodes of pain. Periodic episodes of extreme pain, called pain crises, are a major symptom of sickle cell anemia. Pain develops when sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood flow through tiny blood vessels to your chest, abdomen and joints. The pain varies in intensity and can last for a few hours to a few days. Some people have only a few pain crises a year. Others have a dozen or more a year. A severe pain crisis requires a hospital stay. Some adolescents and adults with sickle cell anemia also have chronic pain, which can result from bone and joint damage, ulcers, and other causes. \nSwelling of hands and feet. The swelling is caused by sickle-shaped red blood cells blocking blood circulation in the hands and feet.\nFrequent infections. Sickle cells can damage the spleen, increasing vulnerability to infections. Infants and children with sickle cell anemia commonly receive vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent potentially life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia.\nDelayed growth or puberty. Red blood cells provide the body with the oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. A shortage of healthy red blood cells can slow growth in infants and children and delay puberty in teenagers.\nVision problems. Tiny blood vessels that supply the eyes can become plugged with sickle cells. This can damage the retina \u2014 the portion of the eye that processes visual images \u2014 and lead to vision problems."

  "symptoms": "Memory loss is the key symptom of Alzheimer's disease. Early signs include difficulty remembering recent events or conversations. But memory gets worse and other symptoms develop as the disease progresses. \n\n\nAt first, someone with the disease may be aware of having trouble remembering things and thinking clearly. As symptoms get worse, a family member or friend may be more likely to notice the issues.\n\n\nBrain changes associated with Alzheimer's disease lead to growing trouble with:\n\n\nMemory\nEveryone has memory lapses at times, but the memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease persists and gets worse. Over time, memory loss affects the ability to function at work or at home.\n\n\nPeople with Alzheimer's disease may:\n\n\n\nRepeat statements and questions over and over.\nForget conversations, appointments or events.\nMisplace items, often putting them in places that don't make sense.\nGet lost in places they used to know well.\nEventually forget the names of family members and everyday objects.\nHave trouble finding the right words for objects, expressing thoughts or taking part in conversations.\n\n\n\nThinking and reasoning\nAlzheimer's disease causes difficulty concentrating and thinking, especially about abstract concepts such as numbers.\n\n\nDoing more than one task at once is especially difficult. It may be challenging to manage finances, balance checkbooks and pay bills on time. Eventually, a person with Alzheimer's disease may be unable to recognize and deal with numbers.\n\n\nMaking judgments and decisions\nAlzheimer's disease causes a decline in the ability to make sensible decisions and judgments in everyday situations. For example, a person may make poor choices in social settings or wear clothes for the wrong type of weather. It may become harder for someone to respond to everyday problems. For example, the person may not know how to handle food burning on the stove or decisions when driving.\n\n\nPlanning and performing familiar tasks\nRoutine activities that require completing steps in order become a struggle. This may include planning and cooking a meal or playing a favorite game. Eventually, people with advanced Alzheimer's disease forget how to do basic tasks such as dressing and bathing.\n\n\nChanges in personality and behavior\nBrain changes that occur in Alzheimer's disease can affect moods and behaviors. Problems may include the following:\n\n\n\nDepression.\nLoss of interest in activities.\nSocial withdrawal.\nMood swings.\nDistrust in others.\nAnger or aggression.\nChanges in sleeping habits.\nWandering.\nLoss of inhibitions.\nDelusions, such as believing something has been stolen.\n\n\n\nPreserved skills\nDespite major changes to memory and skills, people with Alzheimer's disease are able to hold on to some skills even as symptoms get worse. Preserved skills may include reading or listening to books, telling stories, sharing memories, singing, listening to music, dancing, drawing, or doing crafts.\n\n\nThese skills may be preserved longer because they're controlled by parts of the brain affected later in the course of the disease."

Recent memories are most likely to be lost. More-remote or deeply ingrained memories may be spared.\n\n\nFor example, people may recall experiences from childhood or know the names of past presidents. But they may not be able to name the current president, know the month or remember what they ate for breakfast.\n\n\nIsolated memory loss doesn't affect a person's intelligence, general knowledge, awareness or attention span. It also doesn't affect judgment, personality or identity. People with amnesia usually can understand written and spoken words and can learn skills such as bike riding or piano playing. They may understand they have a memory disorder.\n\n\nAmnesia isn't the same as dementia. Dementia often includes memory loss but also involves other problems with thinking that lead to a decline in daily functioning. These problems include having trouble with language, judgment and visual-spatial skills.\n\n\nMemory loss also is a common symptom of mild cognitive impairment. This disorder involves memory and other cognitive problems that aren't as severe as those experienced in dementia.\n\n\nAdditional symptoms\nDepending on the cause of the amnesia, other symptoms may include:\n\n\n\nFalse memories that are either completely invented or are real memories misplaced in time.\nConfusion or disorientation."

  "title": "Albinism",
  "symptoms": "Symptoms of albinism involve skin, hair and eye color, as well as vision.\n\n\nSkin\nThe easiest form of albinism to see results in white hair and very light-colored skin compared with siblings or other blood relatives. But skin coloring, also called pigmentation, and hair color can range from white to brown. People of African descent who have albinism may have skin that is light brown or red brown and have freckles. For some people, skin color may be nearly the same as that of parents or siblings without albinism.\n\n\nWith exposure to the sun, some people may develop:\n\n\n\nFreckles.\nMoles, with or without color, which are sometimes pink.\nLarge freckle-like spots, called solar lentigines (len-TIJ-ih-neez).\nSunburn and no ability to tan.\n\n\n\nFor some people with albinism, skin coloring never changes. For others, melanin production may begin or increase during childhood and the teen years, resulting in slight changes in color.\n\n\nHair\nHair color can range from very white to brown. People of African or Asian descent who have albinism may have hair color that's yellow, red or brown. Hair color also may darken by early adulthood. Or hair may stain from contact with minerals in water and the environment, making hair appear darker with age.\n\n\nEye color\nEyelashes and eyebrows are often pale. Eye color can range from very light blue to brown and may change with age.\n\n\nWith albinism, the colored parts of the eyes, called the irises, usually don't have enough pigment. This allows light to shine through the irises and makes the eyes extremely sensitive to bright light. Because of this, very light-colored eyes may appear red in some lighting.\n\n\nVision\nVision problems are a key feature of all types of albinism. Eye problems may include:\n\n\n\nRapid, back-and-forth movement of the eyes that can't be controlled, called nystagmus.\nAn uncommon head position or head posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movements and see better.\nEyes that can't look at the same direction at the same time or they appear to be crossed, a condition called strabismus.\nProblems seeing near objects or far objects, called farsightedness or nearsightedness.\nExtreme sensitivity to light, called photophobia.\nA difference in the curve of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye, called astigmatism, which causes blurred vision.\nDifferences in the development of the thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eye, called the retina. This difference results in reduced vision.\nNerve signals from the retina to the brain that don't follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye. This is called misrouting of the optic nerve.\nPoor depth perception, which means not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is.\nLegal blindness \u2014 vision less than 20/200 \u2014 or complete blindness."

  "title": "Childhood schizophrenia",
  "symptoms": "Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking, behavior or emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. The effect can be disabling.\n\n\nIn most people with schizophrenia, symptoms generally start in the mid- to late 20s, though it can start later, up to the mid-30s. Schizophrenia is considered early onset when it starts before the age of 18. Onset of schizophrenia in children younger than age 13 is extremely rare.\n\n\nSymptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present. Schizophrenia can be difficult to recognize in the early phases.\n\n\nEarly signs and symptoms\nSchizophrenia signs and symptoms in children and teenagers are similar to those in adults, but the condition may be more difficult to recognize in this age group.\n\n\nEarly signs and symptoms may include problems with thinking, behavior and emotions.\n\n\nThinking:\n\n\n\nProblems with thinking and reasoning\nBizarre ideas or speech\nConfusing dreams or television for reality\n\n\n\nBehavior:\n\n\n\nWithdrawal from friends and family\nTrouble sleeping\nLack of motivation \u2014 for example, showing up as a drop in performance at school\nNot meeting daily expectations, such as bathing or dressing\nBizarre behavior\nViolent or aggressive behavior or agitation\nRecreational drug or nicotine use\n\n\n\nEmotions:\n\n\n\nIrritability or depressed mood\nLack of emotion, or emotions inappropriate for the situation\nStrange anxieties and fears\nExcessive suspicion of others\n\n\n\nLater signs and symptoms\nAs children with schizophrenia age, more typical signs and symptoms of the disorder begin to appear. Signs and symptoms may include:\n\n\n\nDelusions. These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; that certain gestures or comments are directed at you; that you have exceptional ability or fame; that another person is in love with you; or that a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia.\nHallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, hallucinations have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination.\nDisorganized thinking. Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as word salad.\nExtremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. This may show in several ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior is not focused on a goal, which makes it hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement.\nNegative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion \u2014 doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions, speaks in a monotone, or doesn't add hand or head movements that normally occur when speaking. Also, the person may avoid people and activities or lack the ability to experience pleasure.\n\n\n\nCompared with schizophrenia symptoms in adults, children and teens may be:\n\n\n\nLess likely to have delusions\nMore likely to have visual hallucinations\n\n\n\nSymptoms may be difficult to interpret\nWhen childhood schizophrenia begins early in life, symptoms may build up gradually. Early signs and symptoms may be so vague that you can't recognize what's wrong. Some early signs can be mistaken for typical development during early teen years, or they could be symptoms of other mental or physical conditions.\n\n\n\nAs time goes on, signs may become more severe and more noticeable. Eventually, your child may develop the symptoms of psychosis, including hallucinations, delusions and difficulty organizing thoughts. As thoughts become more disorganized, there's often a \"break from reality\" (psychosis) frequently requiring hospitalization and treatment with medication."

You experience more stress than would generally be expected in response to a trying event, and this stress causes a lot of problems in your life.\n\n\nAdjustment disorders affect how you feel and think about yourself and the world. They also may affect your actions or behavior.\n\n\nSome examples include:\n\n\n\nFeeling sad, hopeless or not enjoying things you used to enjoy.\nCrying often.\nWorrying, or feeling anxious, nervous, jittery or stressed out.\nFeeling irritable or like you can't handle anything and don't know where to start.\nHaving trouble sleeping.\nNot eating enough.\nHaving difficulty concentrating.\nHaving difficulty with daily activities.\nWithdrawing from family and friends who support you socially.\nNot doing important things, such as going to work or paying bills.\nThinking about suicide or acting on those thoughts.\n\n\n\nSymptoms of an adjustment disorder start within three months of a stressful event. These symptoms last no longer than six months after the end of the stressful event. But constant or lasting adjustment disorders can continue for more than six months. This is especially true if the stressful event is ongoing, such as being unemployed."

  "title": "Adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)",
  "symptoms": "Some people with ADHD have fewer symptoms as they age, but some adults continue to have major symptoms that interfere with daily functioning. In adults, the main features of ADHD may include difficulty paying attention, impulsiveness and restlessness. Symptoms can range from mild to severe.\n\n\nMany adults with ADHD aren't aware they have it \u2014 they just know that everyday tasks can be a challenge. Adults with ADHD may find it difficult to focus and prioritize, leading to missed deadlines and forgotten meetings or social plans. The inability to control impulses can range from impatience waiting in line or driving in traffic to mood swings and outbursts of anger.\n\n\nAdult ADHD symptoms may include:\n\n\n\nImpulsiveness\nDisorganization and problems prioritizing\nPoor time management skills\nProblems focusing on a task\nTrouble multitasking\nExcessive activity or restlessness\nPoor planning\nLow frustration tolerance\nFrequent mood swings\nProblems following through and completing tasks\nHot temper\nTrouble coping with stress\n\n\n\nWhat's typical behavior and what's ADHD?\nAlmost everyone has some symptoms similar to ADHD at some point in their lives. If your difficulties are recent or occurred only occasionally in the past, you probably don't have ADHD. ADHD is diagnosed only when symptoms are severe enough to cause ongoing problems in more than one area of your life. These persistent and disruptive symptoms can be traced back to early childhood.\n\n\nDiagnosis of ADHD in adults can be difficult because certain ADHD symptoms are similar to those caused by other conditions, such as anxiety or mood disorders. And many adults with ADHD also have at least one other mental health condition, such as depression or anxiety."

  "title": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children",
  "symptoms": "The primary features of ADHD include inattention and hyperactive-impulsive behavior. ADHD symptoms start before age 12, and in some children, they're noticeable as early as 3 years of age. ADHD symptoms can be mild, moderate or severe, and they may continue into adulthood.\n\n\nADHD occurs more often in males than in females, and behaviors can be different in boys and girls. For example, boys may be more hyperactive and girls may tend to be quietly inattentive.\n\n\nThere are three subtypes of ADHD:\n\n\n\nPredominantly inattentive. The majority of symptoms fall under inattention.\nPredominantly hyperactive/impulsive. The majority of symptoms are hyperactive and impulsive.\nCombined. This is a mix of inattentive symptoms and hyperactive/impulsive symptoms.\n\n\n\nInattention\nA child who shows a pattern of inattention may often:\n\n\n\nFail to pay close attention to details or make careless mistakes in schoolwork\nHave trouble staying focused in tasks or play\nAppear not to listen, even when spoken to directly\nHave difficulty following through on instructions and fail to finish schoolwork or chores\nHave trouble organizing tasks and activities\nAvoid or dislike tasks that require focused mental effort, such as homework\nLose items needed for tasks or activities, for example, toys, school assignments, pencils\nBe easily distracted\nForget to do some daily activities, such as forgetting to do chores\n\n\n\nHyperactivity and impulsivity\nA child who shows a pattern of hyperactive and impulsive symptoms may often:\n\n\n\nFidget with or tap his or her hands or feet, or squirm in the seat\nHave difficulty staying seated in the classroom or in other situations\nBe on the go, in constant motion\nRun around or climb in situations when it's not appropriate\nHave trouble playing or doing an activity quietly\nTalk too much\nBlurt out answers, interrupting the questioner\nHave difficulty waiting for his or her turn\nInterrupt or intrude on others' conversations, games or activities\n\n\n\nTypical developmental behavior vs. ADHD\nMost healthy children are inattentive, hyperactive or impulsive at one time or another. It's typical for preschoolers to have short attention spans and be unable to stick with one activity for long. Even in older children and teenagers, attention span often depends on the level of interest.\n\n\nThe same is true of hyperactivity. Young children are naturally energetic \u2014 they often are still full of energy long after they've worn their parents out. In addition, some children just naturally have a higher activity level than others do. Children should never be classified as having ADHD just because they're different from their friends or siblings.\n\n\nChildren who have problems in school but get along well at home or with friends are likely struggling with something other than ADHD. The same is true of children who are hyperactive or inattentive at home, but whose schoolwork and friendships remain unaffected."

If only one eye is affected, you may not notice any changes in your vision. This is because your good eye may compensate for the affected eye. And the condition doesn't affect the side vision, so it does not cause total blindness.\n\n\nDry macular degeneration is one of two types of age-related macular degeneration. It can progress to wet macular degeneration, which is when blood vessels grow and leak under the retina. The dry type is more common, but it usually progresses slowly over years. The wet type is more likely to cause a relatively sudden change in vision resulting in serious vision loss."

  "title": "Rett syndrome",
  "symptoms": "SymptomsBabies with Rett syndrome usually are born after an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Most infants with Rett syndrome seem to grow and behave as expected for the first six months. After that, signs and symptoms start to appear.The most pronounced changes generally occur at 12 to 18 months of age, over a period of weeks or months. Symptoms and their severity vary greatly from child to child.The main signs and symptoms include:\nSlowed growth. Brain growth slows after birth. Smaller than usual head size (microcephaly) is sometimes the first sign that a child has Rett syndrome. As children get older, there is delayed growth in other parts of the body.\nLoss of movement and coordination abilities. The first signs often include reduced hand control and a decreasing ability to crawl or walk. At first, this loss of abilities occurs rapidly, and then it continues more gradually. Eventually muscles become weak or stiff, with unusual movement and positioning.\nLoss of communication abilities. Children with Rett syndrome typically begin to lose the ability to speak, to make eye contact and to communicate in other ways. They may become disinterested in other people, toys and their surroundings. Some children have rapid changes, such as a sudden loss of language. Over time, children may gradually regain eye contact and develop nonverbal communication skills.\nUnusual hand movements. Children with Rett syndrome usually develop repetitive, purposeless hand movements, which differ from child to child. Hand movements may include hand-wringing, squeezing, clapping, tapping or rubbing.\nOther signs and symptoms can include:\nUnusual eye movements. Children with Rett syndrome tend to have unusual eye movements, such as intense staring, blinking, crossed eyes or closing one eye at a time.\nBreathing problems. These include breath holding, rapid breathing (hyperventilation), forcefully blowing out air or saliva, and swallowing air. These problems tend to occur during waking hours. Other breathing disturbances such as shallow breathing or short periods of stopping breathing (apnea) can occur during sleep.\nIrritability and crying. Children with Rett syndrome may become increasingly agitated and irritable as they get older. Periods of crying or screaming may begin suddenly, for no apparent reason, and last for hours. Some children may experience fears and anxiety.\nOther unusual behaviors. These may include, for example, sudden, odd facial expressions and long bouts of laughter, hand licking, and grasping of hair or clothing.\nIntellectual disabilities. Loss of skills may be connected to losing the ability to think, understand and learn.\nSeizures. Most people who have Rett syndrome experience seizures at some time during their lives. Multiple seizure types may occur and are associated with changes on an electroencephalogram (EEG).\nSideways curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Scoliosis is common with Rett syndrome. It typically begins between 8 and 11 years of age and progresses with age. Surgery may be required if the curvature is severe.\nIrregular heartbeat. This is a life-threatening problem for many children and adults with Rett syndrome and can result in sudden death.\nSleep disturbances. Problems with sleep patterns can include irregular sleep times, falling asleep during the day and being awake at night, or waking in the night with crying or screaming.\nOther symptoms. A variety of other symptoms can occur, such as a decreased response to pain; small hands and feet that are usually cold; problems with chewing and swallowing; problems with bowel function; and teeth grinding.\nStages of Rett syndromeRett syndrome is commonly divided into four stages:\nStage 1: Early onset. Signs and symptoms are subtle and easily overlooked during the first stage, which starts between 6 and 18 months of age. Stage 1 can last for a few months or a year. Babies in this stage may show less eye contact and start to lose interest in toys. They may also have delays in sitting or crawling.\nStage 2: Rapid deterioration. Starting between 1 and 4 years of age, children lose the ability to perform skills they previously had. This loss can be rapid or more gradual, occurring over weeks or months. Symptoms of Rett syndrome occur, such as slowed head growth, abnormal hand movements, hyperventilating, screaming or crying for no apparent reason, problems with movement and coordination, and a loss of social interaction and communication.\nStage 3: Plateau. The third stage usually begins between the ages of 2 and 10 years, and it can last for many years. Although problems with movement continue, behavior may slightly improve, with less crying and irritability, and there may be some improvement in hand use and communication. Seizures may begin in this stage and generally don't occur before the age of 2.\nStage 4: Late motor deterioration. This stage usually begins after the age of 10 and can last for years or decades. It's marked by reduced mobility, muscle weakness, joint contractures and scoliosis. Understanding, communication and hand skills generally remain stable or improve slightly, and seizures may occur less often."

Symptoms can develop with moderate or heavy infestation \u2014 a large number of parasites in your body. These symptoms sometimes get worse as the roundworm (trichinella) larvae travel through your body.Initial signs and symptomsYou swallow roundworm (trichinella) larvae in tiny sacks (cysts) containing the parasite. Your digestive juices dissolve the cysts, releasing the larvae into your body. The larvae then enter the wall of your small intestine, where they grow into adult worms and mate. Digestive symptoms can begin 1 to 2 days after infection. At this stage, you may experience:\nDiarrhea\nStomach (abdominal) pain\nSevere tiredness and weakness (fatigue)\nNausea and vomiting\nLater signs and symptomsAbout a week after infection, the adult female worms produce larvae. The larvae go through the wall of your intestine and enter your bloodstream, They travel around the body and bury themselves in muscle tissue. Here, each larva coils up and forms a cyst around itself. Trichinella cysts\n        After you eat roundworm (trichinella) larvae, they grow into adult worms in your small intestine. The adults then produce larvae that move through the bloodstream to muscle tissues, shown here.\n        The larvae can live for months to years inside the muscle tissue.Symptoms caused by muscle tissue invasion usually start 2 to 8 weeks after infection and include:\nHigh fever and chills\nMuscle pain and tenderness\nAching joints\nSwelling of the eyelids or face\nWeakness\nHeadache\nSensitivity to light\nPink eye (conjunctivitis)\nItchy, irritated skin\nWith a large number of parasites, muscle pain and weakness can be severe.

The early infection has five or more follicles \u2014 small bumps that contain lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell \u2014 visible with magnification on the inner surface of your upper eyelid (conjunctiva).\nInflammation \u2014 intense. In this stage, your eye is now highly infectious and becomes irritated, with a thickening or swelling of the upper eyelid.\nEyelid scarring. Repeated infections lead to scarring of the inner eyelid. The scars often appear as white lines when examined with magnification. Your eyelid may become distorted and may turn in (entropion).\nIn-turned eyelashes (trichiasis). The scarred inner lining of your eyelid continues to deform, causing your lashes to turn in so that they rub on and scratch the transparent outer surface of your eye (cornea).\nCorneal clouding (opacity). The cornea becomes affected by an inflammation that is most commonly seen under your upper lid. Continuous inflammation compounded by scratching from the in-turned lashes leads to clouding of the cornea.\n\n\n\nAll the signs of trachoma are more severe in your upper lid than in your lower lid.

  "symptoms": "There are three types of thoracic outlet syndrome:\n\n\n\nNeurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome. This is the most common type of thoracic outlet syndrome. In this type, a group of nerves called the brachial plexus is compressed. The nerves of the brachial plexus come from the spinal cord. The nerves control muscle movements and feeling in the shoulder, arm and hand.\nVenous thoracic outlet syndrome. This type of thoracic outlet syndrome occurs when one or more of the veins under the collarbone are compressed and damaged. This can result in blood clots.\nArterial thoracic outlet syndrome. This is the least common type of TOS. It occurs when one of the arteries under the collarbone is compressed. The compression may cause injury to the artery resulting in a bulge, known as an aneurysm, or blood clot formation.\n\n\n\nThoracic outlet syndrome symptoms can vary depending on the type. When nerves are compressed, symptoms of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome include:\n\n\n\nNumbness or tingling in the arm or fingers.\nPain or aches in the neck, shoulder, arm or hand.\nArm fatigue with activity.\nA weakening grip.\n\n\n\nSymptoms of venous thoracic outlet syndrome can include:\n\n\n\nA change in the color of the hand or one or more fingers.\nHand or arm pain and swelling.\n\n\n\nSymptoms of arterial thoracic outlet syndrome can include:\n\n\n\nA pulsating lump near the collarbone.\nCold fingers, hands or arms.\nHand and arm pain.\nA change in color in one or more of the fingers or the entire hand.\nWeak or no pulse in the affected arm."

Symptoms are different in each stage.Primary TB infection. The first stage is called the primary infection. Immune system cells find and capture the germs. The immune system may completely destroy the germs. But some captured germs may still survive and multiply.Most people don't have symptoms during a primary infection. Some people may get flu-like symptoms, such as:\nLow fever.\nTiredness.\nCough.\nLatent TB infection. Primary infection is usually followed by the stage called latent TB infection. Immune system cells build a wall around lung tissue with TB germs. The germs can't do any more harm if the immune system keeps them under control. But the germs survive. There are no symptoms during latent TB infection.Active TB disease. Active TB disease happens when the immune system can't control an infection. Germs cause disease throughout the lungs or other parts of the body. Active TB disease may happen right after primary infection. But it usually happens after months or years of latent TB infection.Symptoms of active TB disease in the lungs usually begin gradually and worsen over a few weeks. They may include:\nCough.\nCoughing up blood or mucus.\nChest pain.\nPain with breathing or coughing.\nFever.\nChills.\nNight sweats.\nWeight loss.\nNot wanting to eat.\nTiredness.\nNot feeling well in general.\nActive TB disease outside the lungs. TB infection can spread from the lungs to other parts of the body. This is called extrapulmonary tuberculosis. Symptoms vary depending on what part of the body is infected. Common symptoms may include:\nFever.\nChills.\nNight sweats.\nWeight loss.\nNot wanting to eat.\nTiredness.\nNot feeling well in general.\nPain near the site of infection.\nActive TB disease in the voice box is outside the lungs, but it has symptoms more like disease in the lungs.Common sites of active TB disease outside the lungs include:\nKidneys.\nLiver.\nFluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.\nHeart muscles.\nGenitals.\nLymph nodes.\nBones and joints.\nSkin.\nWalls of blood vessels.\nVoice box, also called larynx.\nActive TB disease in children. Symptoms of active TB disease in children vary. Typically, symptoms by age may include the following:\nTeenagers. Symptoms are similar to adult symptoms.\n1- to 12-year-olds. Younger children may have a fever that won't go away and weight loss.\nInfants.The baby doesn't grow or gain weight as expected. Also, a baby may have symptoms from swelling in the fluid around the brain or spinal cord, including:\n  \nBeing sluggish or not active.\nUnusually fussy.\nVomiting.\nPoor feeding.\nBulging soft spot on the head.\nPoor reflexes."

A whooshing sound, called a heart murmur, may be heard.\n\n\nAn echocardiogram is the test used to diagnose total anomalous pulmonary venous return. This test uses sound waves to create images of the heart in motion. An echocardiogram can show the pulmonary veins, any holes in the heart and the size of the heart chambers. It also shows blood flow through the heart and heart valves.\n\n\nOther tests such as an electrocardiogram, a chest X-ray or a CT scan may be done if more information is needed.\n\n\nTreatment\nSurgery for TAPVR is generally needed when a child is a baby. The timing of surgery depends on whether there's a blockage. To repair the heart, surgeons connect the pulmonary veins to the left upper heart chamber. They also close the hole between the upper heart chambers.\n\n\nA person with total anomalous pulmonary venous return needs regular health checkups for life to check for infection, blockages or heart rhythm problems. A doctor trained in congenital heart diseases should provide care. This type of provider is called a congenital cardiologist.\n\n\nBy Mayo Clinic Staff"

But the stages may overlap. And the symptoms don't always happen in the same order. You may be infected with syphilis bacteria without noticing any symptoms for years.\n\n\nPrimary syphilis\nThe first symptom of syphilis is a small sore called a chancre (SHANG-kur). The sore is often painless. It appears at the spot where the bacteria entered your body. Most people with syphilis develop only one chancre. Some people get more than one.\n\n\nThe chancre often forms about three weeks after you come in contact with syphilis bacteria. Many people who have syphilis don't notice the chancre. That's because it's usually painless. It also may be hidden within the vagina or rectum. The chancre heals on its own within 3 to 6 weeks.\n\n\nSecondary syphilis\nYou may get a rash while the first chancre heals or a few weeks after it heals.\n\n\nA rash caused by syphilis:\n\n\n\nOften is not itchy.\nMay look rough, red or reddish-brown.\nMight be so faint that it's hard to see.\n\n\n\nThe rash often starts on the trunk of the body.

But without treatment, the disease might lead to major health problems, also called complications.\n\n\nTertiary syphilis\nAfter the latent stage, up to 30% to 40% of people with syphilis who don't get treatment have complications known as tertiary syphilis. Another name for it is late syphilis.\n\n\nThe disease may damage the:\n\n\n\nBrain.\nNerves.\nEyes.\nHeart.\nBlood vessels.\nLiver.\nBones and joints.\n\n\n\nThese problems may happen many years after the original, untreated infection.\n\n\nSyphilis that spreads\nAt any stage, untreated syphilis can affect the brain, spinal cord, eyes and other body parts. This can cause serious or life-threatening health problems.\n\n\nCongenital syphilis\nPregnant people who have syphilis can pass the disease to their babies. Unborn babies can become infected through the organ that provides nutrients and oxygen in the womb, called the placenta. Infection also can happen during birth.\n\n\nNewborns with congenital syphilis might have no symptoms. But without fast treatment, some babies might get:\n\n\n\nSores and rashes on the skin.\nFever.\nA type of discolored skin and eyes, called jaundice.\nNot enough red blood cells, called anemia.\nSwollen spleen and liver.\nSneezing or stuffed, drippy nose, called rhinitis.\nBone changes.\n\n\n\nLater symptoms may include deafness, teeth problems and saddle nose, a condition in which the bridge of the nose collapses.\n\n\nBabies with syphilis also can be born too early.

  "title": "Staph infections",
  "symptoms": "SymptomsStaph infections can range from minor skin problems to life-threatening illness. For example, endocarditis, a serious infection of the inner lining of your heart (endocardium) can be caused by staph bacteria. Signs and symptoms of staph infections vary widely, depending on the location and severity of the infection.Staph infection\n         infections start out as small red bumps that can quickly turn into deep, painful abscesses.\n        Skin infectionsSkin infections caused by staph bacteria include:\nBoils. The most common type of staph infection is the boil. This is a pocket of pus that develops in a hair follicle or oil gland. The skin over the infected area usually becomes red and swollen. If a boil breaks open, it will probably drain pus. Boils occur most often under the arms or around the groin or buttocks.\nImpetigo. This contagious, often painful rash can be caused by staph bacteria. Impetigo usually has large blisters that may ooze fluid and develop a honey-colored crust.\nCellulitis. Cellulitis is an infection of the deeper layers of skin. It causes redness and swelling on the surface of your skin. Sores or areas of oozing discharge may develop, too.\nStaphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Toxins produced by the staph bacteria may cause staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome. Affecting mostly babies and children, this condition includes a fever, a rash and sometimes blisters. When the blisters break, the top layer of skin comes off. This leaves a red, raw surface that looks like a burn.\nFood poisoningStaph bacteria are one of the most common causes of food poisoning. The bacteria multiply in food and produce toxins that make you sick. Symptoms come on quickly, usually within hours of eating a contaminated food. Symptoms usually disappear quickly, too, often lasting just half a day.A staph infection in food usually doesn't cause a fever. Signs and symptoms you can expect with this type of staph infection include:\nNausea and vomiting\nDiarrhea\nDehydration\nLow blood pressure\nBacteremiaAlso known as a bloodstream infection, bacteremia occurs when staph bacteria enter the bloodstream. A fever and low blood pressure are signs of bacteremia. The bacteria can travel to locations deep within your body to cause infections that affect:\nInternal organs, such as your brain (meningitis), heart (endocarditis) or lungs (pneumonia)\nBones and muscles\nSurgically implanted devices, such as artificial joints or cardiac pacemakers\nToxic shock syndromeThis life-threatening condition results from toxins produced by some strains of staph bacteria. The condition has been linked to certain types of tampons, skin wounds and surgery. It usually develops suddenly with:\nA high fever\nNausea and vomiting\nA rash on your palms and soles that looks like a sunburn\nConfusion\nMuscle aches\nDiarrhea\nStomach pain\nSeptic arthritisSeptic arthritis is often caused by a staph infection. The bacteria often target the knees, shoulders, hips, and fingers or toes. Artificial joints may also be at risk of infection. Signs and symptoms may include:\nJoint swelling\nSevere pain in the affected joint\nFever"

  "title": "Scleroderma",
  "symptoms": "Scleroderma's signs and symptoms vary from person to person, depending on which parts of the body are affected.\n\n\nSkin-related signs and symptoms\nNearly everyone who has scleroderma experiences a hardening and tightening of the skin.\n\n\nThe first parts of the body to be affected are usually the fingers, hands, feet and face. In some people, the skin thickening can also involve the forearms, upper arms, chest, abdomen, lower legs and thighs. Early symptoms may include swelling and itchiness. Affected skin can become lighter or darker in color and may look shiny because of the tightness.\n\n\nSome people also experience small red spots, called telangiectasia, on their hands and face. Calcium deposits can form under the skin, particularly at the fingertips, causing bumps that can be seen on X-rays.\n\n\nRaynaud's phenomenon\nRaynaud's phenomenon is common in scleroderma and occurs because of an inappropriate and exaggerated contraction of the small blood vessels in the fingers and toes in response to the cold or emotional distress. When this happens, the digits may turn white, blue or red, and feel painful or numb. Raynaud's phenomenon also can occur in people who don't have scleroderma.\n\n\nDigestive problems\nScleroderma can affect any part of the digestive system, from the esophagus to the rectum. Depending on which parts of the digestive system are affected, signs and symptoms may include:\n\n\n\nHeartburn\nDifficulty swallowing\nBloating\nDiarrhea\nConstipation\nFecal incontinence\n\n\n\nHeart and lung problems\nWhen scleroderma affects the heart or lungs, it can cause shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance and dizziness. Scleroderma can cause scarring in the lung tissues that may result in increasing shortness of breath over time. There are medications that may help slow the progression of this lung damage.\n\n\nScleroderma can also cause the blood pressure to increase in the circulation that goes between the heart and the lungs. This is called pulmonary hypertension. In addition to shortness of breath, pulmonary hypertension can also cause excess fluid in the legs, feet and sometimes around the heart.\n\n\nWhen scleroderma affects the heart, heartbeats can become irregular. Heart failure may also occur in some people."

  "title": "Schizophrenia",
  "symptoms": "Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognition), behavior and emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. Symptoms may include:\n\n\n\nDelusions. These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; certain gestures or comments are directed at you; you have exceptional ability or fame; another person is in love with you; or a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia.\nHallucinations. These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, they have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination.\nDisorganized thinking (speech). Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as word salad.\nExtremely disorganized or abnormal motor behavior. This may show in a number of ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior isn't focused on a goal, so it's hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement.\nNegative symptoms. This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion (doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions or speaks in a monotone). Also, the person may lose interest in everyday activities, socially withdraw or lack the ability to experience pleasure.\n\n\n\nSymptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present.\n\n\nIn men, schizophrenia symptoms typically start in the early to mid-20s. In women, symptoms typically begin in the late 20s. It's uncommon for children to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and rare for those older than age 45.\n\n\nSymptoms in teenagers\nSchizophrenia symptoms in teenagers are similar to those in adults, but the condition may be more difficult to recognize. This may be in part because some of the early symptoms of schizophrenia in teenagers are common for typical development during teen years, such as:\n\n\n\nWithdrawal from friends and family\nA drop in performance at school\nTrouble sleeping\nIrritability or depressed mood\nLack of motivation\n\n\n\nAlso, recreational substance use, such as marijuana, methamphetamines or LSD, can sometimes cause similar signs and symptoms.\n\n\nCompared with schizophrenia symptoms in adults, teens may be:\n\n\n\nLess likely to have delusions\nMore likely to have visual hallucinations"

  "title": "Seizures",
  "symptoms": "Symptoms vary based on the type of seizure. They also can range from mild to severe. Seizure symptoms may include:\n\n\n\nTemporary confusion.\nA staring spell.\nJerking movements of the arms and legs that can't be controlled.\nLoss of consciousness or awareness.\nCognitive or emotional changes. They may include fear, anxiety or a feeling that you've already lived this moment, known as deja vu.\n\n\n\nA classification system distinguishes the different types of seizures. Health care professionals typically classify seizures as focal or generalized. Seizures are classified based on how and where the brain activity causing the seizure began. If health care professionals don't know how the seizures began, they may classify the seizures as unknown onset.\n\n\nFocal seizures\nFocal seizures result from electrical activity in one area of the brain. This type of seizure can occur with or without loss of consciousness:\n\n\n\nFocal seizures with impaired awareness. These seizures involve a change or loss of consciousness or awareness that feels like being in a dream. People having these types of seizures may seem awake but they stare into space and don't respond to their environment. They may perform repetitive movements such as hand rubbing, mouth movements, repeating certain words or walking in circles. They may not remember the seizure or even know that it occurred.\n\nFocal seizures without impaired awareness. These seizures may alter emotions. They also may change the way things look, smell, feel, taste or sound. But the seizures don't cause a loss of consciousness.\nDuring these types of seizures, people may suddenly feel angry, joyful or sad. Some people have nausea or unusual feelings that are hard to describe. These seizures may result in trouble speaking and involuntary jerking of a body part such as an arm or a leg. They also may cause sudden sensory symptoms such as tingling, dizziness and seeing flashing lights.\n\n\n\n\nSymptoms of focal seizures may be confused with other conditions of the brain or nervous system. They include migraine, narcolepsy or mental illness.\n\n\nGeneralized seizures\nSeizures that appear to involve all areas of the brain from the time they start are called generalized seizures. Different types of generalized seizures include:\n\n\n\nAbsence seizures. Absence seizures, formerly known as petit mal seizures, often occur in children. Absence seizures typically cause a person to stare into space or make subtle body movements such as eye blinking or lip smacking. They usually last for 5 to 10 seconds. These seizures may happen up to hundreds of times a day. They may occur in clusters and can cause a brief loss of awareness.\nTonic seizures. Tonic seizures cause stiffening of the muscles. These seizures usually affect muscles in the back, arms and legs. People who experience these seizures may lose consciousness and fall to the ground.\nAtonic seizures. Atonic seizures, also known as drop seizures, cause a loss of muscle control. People having this type of seizure may suddenly fall down or drop their head.\nClonic seizures. Clonic seizures are associated with repeated jerking muscle movements. These seizures usually affect the neck, face and arms on both sides of the body.\nMyoclonic seizures. Myoclonic seizures usually appear as sudden brief jerks or twitches of the arms and legs. There is often no loss of consciousness.\nTonic-clonic seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures, previously known as grand mal seizures, are the most dramatic type of epileptic seizure. They can cause a sudden loss of consciousness, body stiffening and shaking. They sometimes cause people to lose control of their bladder or to bite their tongue. They may last for several minutes. Tonic-clonic seizures also may start as focal seizures that then spread to involve most or all of the brain.\n\n\n\nSeizure stages\nSeizures can have a beginning phase, middle phase and end phase.\n\n\n\n\nProdrome. This is the earliest warning that a seizure may occur, but it is not part of the seizure itself. During the prodrome, people may have a hard-to-describe sense that a seizure may happen. They also may have changes in behavior. This can happen in the hours or even days before a seizure.\nThe prodrome stage may include an aura. The aura is the first symptom of a seizure. Symptoms during the aura may include the feeling that a person or place is familiar, known as deja vu, or a feeling that a person or place is not familiar. Or people may simply feel strange, feel fear or panic, or even have pleasant feelings. Symptoms also may include smells, sounds, tastes, blurred vision or racing thoughts. The prodrome may include a headache, numbness or tingling, nausea, or dizziness.\nMany people with seizures have a prodrome or aura as part of their experience, but some people do not.\n\nIctal. The middle part of a seizure is called the ictal phase. The ictal phase spans the time from the first symptom to the end of the seizure. Symptoms of the ictal phase depend on the type of seizure.\n\nPostictal. This is the period after a seizure during recovery. The postictal stage can last minutes or hours. Some people recover quickly while others take hours. The length of the postictal stage depends on the type of seizure and what part of the brain was affected.\nDuring this phase, people may be slow to respond, have trouble with memory, and have trouble talking or writing. They may feel sleepy, confused, dizzy, sad, scared, anxious or frustrated. They also may have nausea, a headache, weakness, feel thirsty or have a loss of bladder control."

Paralysis below the neck, including both arms and legs, is called quadriplegia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ability to control your arms or legs after a spinal cord injury depends on two factors. One factor is where the injury occurred on the spinal cord. The other factor is how bad the injury is.\n\n\nThe lowest part of the spinal cord not damaged after an injury is known as the neurological level of the injury. \"The completeness\" of the injury refers to how much feeling, known as sensation, is lost.
